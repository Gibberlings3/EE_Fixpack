(Alteration, Evocation)

Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Wizards need not always be wizards—Tenser's Transformation changes the caster into a heroic warrior, doubling the caster's Hit Points and giving <PRO_HIMHER> a +4 bonus to Armor Class, a +2 bonus to-hit and to damage, and one extra attack per round. All damage the caster sustains takes away from the bonus Hit Points first, and <PRO_HISHER> attacks have the same chance to hit as a Fighter of the same level. While transformed, the wizard cannot cast spells.~

Duration: 11 turns
Casting Time: 3

Saving Throw: Neg.

Symbol, Pain is a powerful enchantment that allows the priest to inscribe a symbol on the ground or any other surface. The symbol will remain there until someone comes too close, at which point it will explode, causing all those within the area of effect to make a Saving Throw vs. Spell. Those who fail their Saving Throws are overwhelmed by pain, suffering a -4 penalty to their attack rolls, a -2 penalty to their Dexterity scores, and a -2 penalty to their Armor Class.~

// ranger charm animal description doesn't mention the duration of the charm; added the sentence at the end of the first paragraph
@40299 = ~Charm Animal

This ability allows a Ranger to charm an animal and manipulate its behavior. The animal is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Wand to negate the effect. If the animal fails its Saving Throw, it regards the Ranger as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected for 1 turn. The Ranger may give it orders, and the charmed animal will carry them out to the best of its ability. The charm lasts for one turn.

If the Ranger harms or attempts to harm the charmed animal, the charm is broken. If two or more charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent one takes precedence.~

@40639 = ~Not much is known about the owner of this weapon, save that sages believe it is from another world called "Eibrancha." Plane-traveling wizards who have investigated life on "Eibrancha" report that it is dull, commonplace, and ordinary in the extreme, a place where heroes are rare and the populace is, by and large, incredibly average. This might explain the virtually nonexistent body of recorded information about the place. The only thing known about the weapon's owner is that he was an educated man. The purple wood that the crossbow is constructed from is believed to be from a unique type of tree in Eibrancha.

After contacting another plane and learning about Bren Muller, you have learned a new ability of the weapon. Once per day, it can dramatically increase accuracy for two rounds.
