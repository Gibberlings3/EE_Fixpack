Phaere has told me of Ardulace's plan in its entirety. The drow intend to invade the surface... to what end, I don't know. But Matron Ardulace's ritual is going to summon a great demon to aid the drow. The dragon eggs will be sacrificed to the demon in return for its service, and this will place House Despana in great favor with Lolth.

Phaere intends to betray Matron Ardulace and has coerced me into helping her. She wants me to go to the Despana treasury (in Lolth's temple) and replace the silver dragon's eggs with fake eggs that Phaere has had made. Then when Ardulace offers the demon the fake eggs, Phaere can step in with the real ones.

I must be careful if I go to the treasury... killing the guards, if it is done, must be done discreetly if at all. And even once I get the eggs, the city has been sealed by Matron Ardulace... there is no escaping. I must continue to play along... for now.~

Casting Time: 8

(Abjuration)

Level: 7
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This powerful abjuration spell causes the spells cast against the priest to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total number of spell levels equal to half the level of the caster. It includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes area effects that are not centered directly upon the priest and area effects that are stationary, such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud.

As long as there are levels remaining, the spell will be absorbed. For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the priest, the spell will be absorbed while canceling the shield.

This spell will not protect the caster from Dispel Magic, but it will not be dispelled by Dispel Magic either.~

Advantages:
– +1 to hit and damage rolls with any missile weapon every 3 levels through level 18.
– +1 to hit and damage rolls with any missile weapon every 5 levels from level 23 onwards.
– May achieve Grand Mastery (5 slots) in longbows, shortbows, and crossbows.
– May use the Called Shot ability once per day. Gains one use at level 4 and an additional use every 4 levels thereafter.

CALLED SHOT: All successful ranged attacks within the next 10 seconds have the following cumulative effects besides normal damage, according to the level of the Archer:
 4th level: -1 penalty to target's THAC0.
 8th level: -1 penalty to target's Saving Throws vs. Spell.
 12th level: -1 penalty to the target's Strength score.
 16th level: +2 bonus to damage roll.

Disadvantages:

Level: 4

Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 10-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, all allied creatures within a 10-ft. radius are affected individually by Protection From Evil. It creates a magical barrier around the recipients at a distance of one foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has two major effects: First, all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures against the protected creature receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll. Second, summoned demons cannot target protected creatures.~

(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 6
Range: 120 ft.
Duration: 7 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

There are two parts to this spell. First, a small portal opens and summons one or two carrion crawlers to a point designated by the wizard. Second, the magic mutates the carrion crawlers into larger, more vicious versions of themselves. The wizard now has control over these creature(s) until they are slain or the spell's duration expires. There is a 35% chance that two carrion crawlers will be summoned instead of one.~

(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 6
Range: 25 ft.
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By casting Summon Nishruu, a wizard calls into existence a magical being of considerable power: the nishruu. At first glance, this appears to be some sort of mist, but upon closer examination, this boiling, churning gray mass of vapors and shapes moves with a life of its own. Drawn toward magic like a moth to the flame, the nishruu feeds on the energies surrounding and used by wizards. Luckily, there is no question as to the loyalty of the creature, and it will not attack its summoner even though it would like nothing better.

The nishruu has no physical attacks at all, although physical attacks can hurt it. Each time a nishruu touches a target wizard and wraps its tendrils around <PRO_HIMHER>, two things happen: First, all magical items with charges in the possession of the target will be drained by 1 charge, destroying them if only 1 charge was left; second, the wizard loses 1 random spell of the highest level currently memorized. The nishruu is completely immune to energy damage, and magic will actually heal it. The creature will remain under the wizard's control until slain or until the spell's duration expires.~

Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 120-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, an area roughly 120 ft. in radius around the caster will be affected. Instantly and once per round for 1 turn after this spell is cast, all hostile Illusion/Phantasm spells in the area of effect will be dispelled. The spells that are affected by this are Reflected Image, Invisibility, Mirror Image, Non-Detection, Improved Invisibility, Shadow Door, Mislead, Project Image, and Simulacrum. The area of effect is roughly a 120-ft. radius around the caster. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not come into effect with this spell. This spell only affects enemies, thus it is unable to dispel invisibility from a party member.~

Level: 3
Range: 70 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Path of bolt
Saving Throw: 1/2

Upon casting this spell, the wizard releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy that inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster (maximum damage of 10d6) to each creature within its area of effect. A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell reduces this damage to half (round fractions down). If the lightning bolt intersects with a wall, it will bounce until it reaches its full length.~

@45867 = ~MONK: Monks are warriors who pursue perfection through contemplation as well as action. They are versatile fighters, especially skilled in combat without weapons or armor. Though Monks cannot cast spells, they have a unique magic of their own: They channel a subtle energy, called ki, which allows them to perform amazing feats. The Monk's best known feat is their ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow.

Advantages:

SUN SOULRAY: The Sun Soul Monk projects a blast of light from <PRO_HISHER> open palm, dealing 1d8 fire damage for every 2 caster levels (up to a maximum of 5d8 damage) to a single target. Undead creatures take an additional 6 points of damage.

– 13th level: May cast Sun Soulbeam once per day.

SUN SOULBEAM: The Sun Soul Monk emits a dazzling burst of light that strikes at all other creatures within a 15-ft. radius.

@100356 = ~Charm Animal
This spell affects any single animal it is cast upon. The animal is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell to negate the effect. The charm lasts for two turns.

If the spell's recipient fails its Saving Throw, it regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give it orders, and the charmed animal will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harms—or attempts to harm—the charmed animal by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed animal, the Charm spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Note that the subject will be hostile when the Charm expires, regardless of its original attitude. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where it was charmed.~
