Armor Class: 5

Usable only by Annah

This armor has been woven from the hides of various Abyssal vermin. The stitching thread appears to be a single white hair (though the type of creature is unknown). There are no metal fixtures, studs, or buckles anywhere on the armor... it is composed solely from the remains of living creatures.~

A ridge of huge black spikes bristle along the knuckles of these metal gauntlets, allowing the wearer to perforate any target they punch. Clamps line the edges of the gauntlets to secure them in place once worn

This gauntlets bear an enchantment that allows the user to strike opponents with the strength of ten men. The spikes along the knuckles simply add insult to injury, as any victim whose bones are not shattered by the initial attack will slowly bleed to death from the jagged wounds the spikes inflict.~

THAC0: +2
Speed: 10
Weight: 10
Proficiency: Hammers
Usable only by Fighters

Research reveals that this is a formidable weapon indeed. Far superior to a normal sledgehammer, this war hammer (also called "The Hammer of Comminution") delivers a devastating strike that not only inflicts crushing damage, but also fractures any surface it contacts, whether bone, metal, or wood, inflicting extra damage... and if the victim survives, it also "softens" him up for the next attack

The Hammer of Comminution was used extensively by Enote, a Doomguard priest, in 14 E.U. A philosopher who was prone to violent mood swings while debating theology, he was known to espouse the virtues of the hammer as a means of furthering the decay of dead matter. Whether or not what he struck with the hammer was dead or alive before the blow is open to debate.~

Usable only by Fighters
Not usable by Good characters

This huge axe makes you uncomfortable. Bones have been embedded into its surface, and a light sheen of red, possibly blood seem to have mortared the skulls into the shaft of the axe. The blade itself looks to be a mish mash of sharpened teeth pried from the jaws of some huge creature

The mere presence of the axe sets you on edge... for some reason, simply having it in your possession makes you angry.~

Damage: 3-13 Slashing

Proficiency: Axes
Usable only by Fighters
Not usable by Good characters

It is not exactly clear in the annals of known planar history when "Hatred's Gift" was created, but by the bloody trail it has left across the planes seems to have finally reached you

The axe exists to inspire hatred in one's enemies and fill its wielder with a berserker rage. When entering combat, the skulls along the shaft come alive, chittering their teeth, and the teeth (remnants of fiendish victims absorbed into the axe blade) extend outwards, biting and tearing into opponents with each strike

Once equipped, "Hatred's Gift" cannot be dropped unless its curse is removed.~

Usable only by Fighters
Not usable by Good characters

When its powers are awakened and its name known, "Edge of Oblivion" becomes entirely black... where once just the edges were ebony, now the blackness has spread across the entire blade. The chill the blade radiates has increased ten-fold, so much so that it is painful to hold it for too long.

"Edge of Oblivion" does disintegration damage every time it strikes an opponent... for every wound it causes, it also disintegrates the flesh around the target area, simultaneously cauterizing the wound as it strikes

There is some speculation that a Sphere of Annihilation has somehow been encaged within the axe itself, but again this is only speculation. Given that the planes are infinite, anything is possible.~

This tanar'ri femur carries the last traces of a balor's essence within its marrow. Disgraced in battle and torn apart by its fellow fiends in a ceremonial execution, the bone has since carried with it a vengeful spite towards all of its kind

When the femur strikes any tanar'ri or baatezu, serrated teeth bristle up and down the length of the bone and cause tremendous damage to any tanar'ri or baatezu.~

Something about this crutch makes you wonder - despite its fragile appearance, it has held up rather well; you even test it with your weight and it holds you up without so much as creaking. Considering Pharod's scavenging nature, the crutch may have had some value beyond its surface appearance for him. It might even be usable as a weapon.~

This weapon has a black metal handle that seems to have grown into the narrow skull that is affixed to its top. The metal looks as if it has grown out from the skull, and spikes pierce through the eye sockets, jaw, and from the skull cap itself

The skull is not human. For one thing, it has stubs where horns used to be (and looked as if they were gnawn off - teeth marks are visible around the edges) and second of all, the ridges of needle-like teeth that are part of the jaw don't belong to any human you have ever seen. If you were to hazard a guess, the entire skull looks faintly reptilian.~

This weapon has a black metal handle that seems to have grown into the narrow skull that is affixed to its top. The metal looks as if it has grown out from the skull, and spikes pierce through the eye sockets, jaw, and from the skull cap itself

The "metal" is not metal at all, but the remnants of a creature's forearm that punched through the base of the fiendish skull that now bedecks the head of this weapon. The spikes that have pierced through the skull actually appear to be some sort of quills from the creature's forearm.

When this weapon is used in combat and the spikes of the club penetrate a creature's skin, acid oozes from the quills into the target, doing additional damage. This acid also burns the hands of the user, doing some damage to the wielder every time he strikes someone else.

The common name of this weapon is "Devil's Due." To who or what event it refers to is unknown, but it was obviously a painful experience for the two parties involved.~

@234 = ~NORDOM'S CROSSBOWS
Damage: Varies According to Ammo
Enchanted: +1
THAC0: +1
Speed: 10
Weight: 7
Proficiency: Missiles
Usable only by Nordom

Nordom's home plane of Mechanus is driven by great clockwork gears. Tending these gears and making sure they run smoothly are given to creatures called "gear spirits." These gear spirits have the ability to turn themselves into almost any tool or common mechanical device... even crossbows. Nordom's crossbows are two such gear spirits, and they seem to have willingly fled with him from Mechanus

Their duties are so essential to the smooth functioning of Mechanus that the modrons have officially assigned these spirits to the various gears. While the gear spirits love the gears they tend so much, their servitude to the modrons rankles them, making them somewhat disgruntled. As a result, there are tales of gear spirits that leave the great gears of Mechanus, leaving their duties for a while to sample the planes beyond their own. Most likely, Nordom's two crossbows caught this wanderlust, and they now piggyback along with him, peppering any hostile creature they see with crossbow bolts. The gear spirits can make endless supplies of these bolts, so there is never any need for Nordom to reload unless he wishes to fire new crossbow bolts.

The crossbows occasionally make small clicking and rattling noises. They seem to be talking to each other, but their conversation is indecipherable. They're most likely discussing the finer points of crossbow mechanics.~

Area of Effect: 1 creature (non-undead)
Saving Throw: Neg.

Morte can draw upon his repertoire of insults to taunt an opponent into lowering his guard and attacking. The target suffers penalties to hit and damage when enraged.

This spell cannot target undead creatures. Magic resistance does not affect this spell. The target does get a saving throw vs. Spells to resist the effect, however. While the target is "taunted," the target suffers a -2 to hit and a -2 to AC and a -2 to damage as long as the Litany of Curses is in effect.

Her punishment ranges from the Mazes - a twisting, turning hell with a cleverly disguised exit - to the casting of her shadow across the transgressor, covering him with slashes and gouges from her sharp-edged shadow, leaving behind a pile of gore and viscera.

Special:
   Minor Copper Blessing
  +1 to Luck (temporary)
Weight: 0

This copper piece has been "clipped"... most of the copper has been shaved off, no doubt to still keep the appearance it is a coin and allowing the 'clipper' to use the shaved copper to make another coin. Although many Hive dwellers practice this method of "making money," when the Fated faction practices it, they do so with a frightening sense of purpose, creating charms that reflect their own miserly natures

In order to create these charms, the Fated faction seek out failed business owners and other individuals who once possessed great wealth, then had a reversal of fortune and were left destitute. These individuals are then given enchanted carving blades and asked to "clip a copper" for the Fated in a tedious day-long ritual, which infuses the copper coin with the last traces of their former luck. The ritual and the nature of the individual clipping the copper allows a minor enchantment to seep into the coin and affect the fortune of whoever uses it

When the clipped copper charm is flipped into the air, it will spill into a rain of copper pieces, and bestow some luck upon the user.~

This piece of charcoal is a charred bone fragment of some creature, perhaps a finger bone or a talon. Various symbols have been scratched onto its surface... the scratchings are so faint you almost missed them

This charcoal charm temporarily protects the user against flames and extreme heat. To use the charm, the charred bone is snapped and both halves are ground to powder, then the charcoal dust is rubbed over the heart of the user.~

   New Tattoos
Speed: 4
Weight: 5
Proficiency: Clubs
Usable only by Fighters and Thieves

This severed arm is as hard as a wooden club. It looks like it was severed cleanly at the shoulder (most likely by a scythe blade), and even though it looks many decades old, it is more petrified than rotted. It has an unhealthy gray pallor and is covered with scars. Intricate tattoos decorate its surface, spiraling up from the wrist all the way to the remains of the shoulder

Upon closer inspection, you know for a fact that this arm is yours. How long it has been lying around waiting for you is anyone's guess. You can't explain why, but you feel like you should take this arm to a tattoo artist and have it examined... the tattoos might tell something of what happened to your previous incarnation when this arm was still attached to him.~

This small metal toy is a replica of a cube-like mechanical creature with huge eyes on one of its faces. The toy has two legs, two arms, two folding wings, and at least eighteen points of articulation. Maybe it's a collector's item.

There is a little switch on the back that moves the eyes back and forth, and the wings are made of some tissue-like metal that folds up neatly when the wings are flush with the body.

My Love,

If you are reading this, then the tragedy I have Seen has come to pass. I have died, and you have remained to suffer the loss.

Know this, my Love... I know why you were forced to shield your feelings from me. You sought to protect me from the terrible burden you carry with you. The distance you kept between us was your way of protecting me, and the brief moments when we were alone and you let your feelings be known, *that* was when I knew you cared for me. Carry no regrets with you, carry no guilt, for I came with you on your haunted journey of my own accord, and no matter how death came for me, I know that you did everything in your power to save me.

Our lives are intertwined my Love, and death shall not be a wall between us.

For my Sight has seen what is to come, only in staccato segments, but it is enough for me to know that we will be separated for a time, but we shall be reconciled again. Thus, do not see my death as a farewell, but only as an interval before we meet again. Carry my ring with you, and these other pieces of me, and think of me. Keep me in your mind and heart, and that will be the beacon that brings us together.

Forever,
Deionarra.~

This tissue-thin vellum scroll was part of Deionarra's legacy. The scroll is neatly rolled up and wrapped with a red ribbon. When the ribbon is opened, the healing magic contained within the scroll is released

The scroll will heal even the most critical of wounds. It disintegrates into powder when used.~

Usable only by Dak'kon

On the githzerai's home plane of Limbo, solid matter is something of a rarity. Limbo itself is a soupy mass of elements, and only through force of will can the githzerai shape these elements into stable matter

A substance called "karach" is a material that can be shaped with the mind. Dak'kon's blade is composed of this substance; through mental discipline alone, Dak'kon maintains the integrity of the blade. He can shape it slightly depending on his skill, adjusting its length, sharpness of the edge. Presumably as he gains levels, he may be able to manipulate the blade in new ways

It is not known whether all githzerai *zerth* carry such weapons. Certainly a weapon that depends on the integrity of the wielder would be entrusted only to those who had learned to discipline themselves.

This blade appears to have special religious significance for Dak'kon. Dak'kon has wound a series of parchments around the hilt of the blade. These appear to be mantras dedicated to Zerthimon.~

Dak'kon must be suffering indeed, for his *karach* blade has become a dead flat black, mirroring Dak'kon's eyes. It has become longer, sharper, and a series of subtle jags, like teeth, now line the edge of the blade.

This small round stone is the "Unbroken Circle of Zerthimon." The Unbroken Circle is a *zerth* religious text, containing teachings of Zerthimon, the founder of the githzerai people. The Circle is made up of a series of interlocking circles that fold out from one another, depending on which branch the reader wishes to follow in the path of teachings... it is said that some *zerths* spend years poring over the combinations of the plates, looking for new significance in the teachings

Dak'kon seems to use the text as a means of focusing his spell casting abilities, for he pores over the tablet occasionally, memorizing the words.~

The edge of the blade tapers almost to a paper-thin line - despite its flimsy appearance, it looks like it could cut through chain armor with ease. In addition, the blade itself seems much faster... it seems to *flow* as Dak'kon swings it through the air

Blood flies are pests believed to have originated from one of the Lower Planes. In many ways, they resemble mosquitoes with an insatiable appetite - a cloud of blood flies can suck all the blood from a human body within minutes. Their stingers are capable of penetrating even the skin of fiends.

Despite their vicious appetite and temperament, blood flies are used by healers to draw forth diseased blood from an individual or even drain blood from a dead body. On occasion, blood flies are used to siphon off rare types of blood and are then paralyzed with powders or spells and kept in storage for future use

This particular blood fly charm seems to hold the blood of a lesser fiend, an abishai, in its food sac.

Usable only by Indeps

This barbed earring marks the wearer as a member of the Indep faction. This earring is the home of an independent spirit which accompanies the wearer and does its best to protect him from harm. Whenever possible, the spirit gives its wearer a mental nudge to get them out of harm's way... the tiny counseling spirit provides the user with +1 to all Saving Throws, and its mere presence gives the wearer an additional bonus to avoid spells and confusion effects.

Many of these enchanted items were made in the bazaars of Sigil by a silversmith from Oerth, who had found a way of shaping metal in such a way that it attracted "free spirits" to the metal and caused them to take up residence there. The spirit is not bound to the earring by any means; from what scholars have determined, there is something about the earring that the spirits find "cozy."~

Cockroaches are as common on the planes as other scavengers. The shell of this particular dead cockroach has been dotted with paints and faint arcane symbols. The magic contained within the charm is activated when the roach is consumed

When swallowed, the recipient temporarily gains the protection of the cockroach. Their skin hardens, taking on the strength of a suit of chain mail armor, and the charmed individual becomes difficult to squash, giving them added protection vs. crushing attacks.~

These three cranium rat tails have been woven into a small charm. Despite the separation from their owners, however, they still twitch occasionally, as if irritated

To use this charm, the caster must select a target within his line of sight, then, while remaining focused on the target, untie the charm. The target's vision will turn black for several minutes, rendering them helpless and reducing their combat ability drastically.~

This glistening blood drop is as hard and smooth as a pearl. When placed on the tongue, it dissolves instantly and spreads through the user's bloodstream

The charm stimulates the user's blood into clotting and scabbing over existing wounds, healing any minor damage the user may have suffered before consuming the charm. Furthermore, as long as the charm is in effect, the player's blood becomes more "aware" of new wounds that occur, especially any attacks that draw blood. The charmed individual becomes more resistant to slashing and piercing attacks, as their blood clots and scabs over the wound as soon as the flesh is torn.~

The knot binding the two ends of this rope together holds a powerful magic. When this knot is severed by a fighter with an edged weapon, the warrior gains a rush of confidence and arrogance, reducing their Wisdom but raising their Charisma. The user is also beset with the urge to gather an army and rush out and conquer the planes, but this urge does not rule the user's actions.

It is said that this is a knotted piece of rope that was cut in two by a conqueror on a distant prime material world. Every time the knot is severed, it disappears, showing up years later in the hands of another who can make use of its power.~

This cranium rat tail charm is particularly filthy and smells faintly of vomit. The tail is stiff, like a wire, and it can be bent into different shapes... it would almost make a great lockpick, except it is too thick

When this rank charm is consumed, the user temporarily becomes much stealthier and shiftier, giving them a greater chance of success with hiding in shadows and picking pockets. People viewing the charmed individual will detect something unsavory about him, however, reducing first impressions accordingly. This unsavoriness will last only as long as the charm is in effect, however.~

Like its younger cousin, the clot charm, the blood charm stimulates the user's blood into clotting and scabbing over existing wounds, healing damage the user may have suffered before consuming the charm. However, while the blood charm's initial healing effect is more powerful than the clot charm, it has no other lasting effects.~

@30601 = ~STONE GULLET OF L'PHAHL THE GROSS
(Unique, Artifact)
Special:
   Permanent +1 to Save vs. Poison
   Permanent +15% Resistance to Acid
Weight: 3

The Gurgling Stone Gullet of L'Phahl the Gross is not as well-known as most artifacts tend to be; no wars have been waged over it, no betrayals, no epic journeys into the underworld... only a few moralizing sorcerers, a fat man, and his stomach.

As the "legend" goes, L'Phahl the Gross was said to have been a promising practitioner of the Art, a sorcerer's apprentice to one of the Last Seers of Es-Annon. Despite his skill at the Art, however, his gluttony was the subject of much ridicule among his peers

During the last great Massing of Es-Annon, L'Phahl was invited to dine at the center table, but unknown to him, his peers had filled his wine goblet with an elixir of turning flesh to stone to teach the rotund student a "lesson."

L'Phahl consumed such great amounts of food and drink during the Mass, however, that it diluted the potion's effects. Complaining of a stomach ache hours after the feast, the local healers discovered that L'Phahl's stomach had turned into stone, yet was still capable of digesting food. L'Phahl lived the rest of his days happily eating, though his gullet was a few pounds heavier than before

When he finally died, his stomach was removed as an oddity... and since then, it has 'wandered' the planes in search of new stomachs

To use the artifact, one must consume it (it has the consistency of stale bread)... so doing will turn the eater's stomach into the stone gullet. Devouring the stone gullet of L'Phahl will grant the user the blessing of stone and rock and slight resistance to (stomach) acid.~

@30673 = ~BLOOD FLY CHARM (ABISHAI)
Special:
   Heals 3 Hit Points
   Increases Regeneration
Weight: 0

Blood flies are pests believed to have originated from one of the Lower Planes. In many ways, they resemble mosquitoes with an insatiable appetite - a cloud of blood flies can suck all the blood from a human body within minutes. Their stingers are capable of penetrating even the skin of fiends.

Despite their vicious appetite and temperament, blood flies are used by healers to draw forth diseased blood from an individual or even drain blood from a dead body. On occasion, blood flies are used to siphon off rare types of blood and are then paralyzed with powders or spells and kept in storage for future use

This particular blood fly charm seems to hold the blood of a lesser fiend, an abishai, in its food sac. When this paralyzed fly is consumed, the user heals a small amount of damage immediately and also gains the ability to regenerate for a certain period of time. If the character is already able to regenerate, then the regeneration rate is increased.~

This tattoo is created from the four symbols of the Revolutionary League. Wearing this openly is not a good idea.

The Revolutionary League believes that all power structures should be overthrown, and they have devoted themselves to seeing that this occurs. They are the natural enemies of nearly all the other factions, and so they must move quickly when identified.

The problem with this tattoo, of course, is that it immediately identifies its wearer as an Anarchist. Authority figures have a problem with this.~

"Please, to whatever Dustman reads this; I beg of you. I know of my legal obligation under the terms of the Dead Contract, but I am prepared to offer *more* than my signing fee if you will cremate my body rather than Raising it. I have arranged for this note to be left with my body upon my death. If you are reading this, then please use this note as instructed and accept the result in exchange for my Contracted duty. Let my Contract number serve as the key."

It looks like the corpse was too late to prevent the Raising... but you notice that beneath the writing is a diagram. It looks like directions for folding the parchment into a strange pattern

When in combat the user of this dagger can hear a constant chittering in the back of his mind causing him to lose all self-control making him unstoppable in combat, but vulnerable to spells.

The history of this dagger is for the most part unknown. More than likely some berk perished while fighting the fiend, losing his dagger as well as his life. For now the name is but a description, it has yet to earn a proper title.~

@41705 = ~FANGED MIRROR OF YEHCIR-EYA
(Minor Artifact)
Invokes "Soul Exodus"
Weight: 1

The Fanged Mirrors of Yehcir-Eya were the hope of an empire

The last Great Matriarch of the Sea of Black Sand, Yehcir-Eya, found herself slowly dying. Surrounded by rival nations that wished to claim her lands for her own, Yehcir-Eya sought to choose one of the Lesser Matriarchs from the surrounding nations and enter into an alliance, preserving her nation against invasion. Yet she knew not which of the Lesser Matriarchs to trust

Consulting her oracles, she asked them for a means of testing the hearts of the Lesser Matriarchs. They told her to travel to the edges of the Sea of Black Sand - there, where the shifting black sand gave way to slate, she would find what she sought

The Great Matriarch journeyed many leagues, travelling on foot until she reached the edges of the Great Sea. There, her feet fell upon a great plate of silvered glass the size of a courtyard embedded in the floor of the desert

Her oracles instructed her to cut the great glass and fashion thirty-three mirrors. These mirrors were sent to the Lesser Matriarchs of the surrounding nations as gifts. The mirrors would test their hearts, the oracles predicted

No one is certain what happened on that final night, but with every mirror that was delivered, a Lesser Matriarch fell dead. There were wild tales of spectral forms that crawled from the bodies of the Lesser Matriarchs as they gazed upon the mirrors, and the howling cries as they strangled their owners

In response to the assassination of their leaders, the surrounding nations attacked the nation of Yehcir-Eya and razed it to the ground. The Fanged Mirrors of Yehcir-Eya were scattered and lost

According to several planar scholars, the Fanged Mirrors had the ability to cause a soul to slip from its owner and take on physical form. Whether it was because the Lesser Matriarchs were consumed by greed and a desire for conquest or whether the great plate of silvered glass found on the edges of the Sea of Black Sand was evil in itself, the mirrors created a vicious reflection of their owners. Their souls took on substance and killed their owners

The fanged mirror can be used against an opponent - when used, it will reflect a spectral version of the target that will appear and attempt to kill him.~

@46626 = ~BOLTS OF ACHERON
Damage: 2-5 Crushing
Enchanted: +1
Special: Causes Stunning
THAC0: +1
Speed: 10
Weight: 0
Proficiency: Missiles

These enchanted bolts have been fashioned from one of the great cubes of Acheron. According to many planar scholars, Acheron is a plane in perpetual war with itself, where huge cubes the size of continents float through the ether and smash against each other. On the surface of these cubes, legions of soldiers wage war on each other, swarming from cube to cube and attacking whoever else they can find. The plane is filled with the ringing of steel and the great thundering impacts of the cubes striking each other

These bolts carry a portion of Acheron's heart within them. When these bolts strike an opponent, they do so with so much force that the impact has the potential to stun an opponent and leave him helpless for a period of time.~

@46627 = ~ACIDIC SPONGE BOLTS
Damage: 1-2 Crushing
Special: 6 Acid Damage on Impact
Speed: 10
Weight: 0
Proficiency: Missiles

The putty-like globes on the heads of these crossbow bolts are actually dried-up aquatic sponges found in many of the great lakes of Bytopia. Seemingly unremarkable to most scholars, these tiny sponges were accidentally discovered to have the property of being able to absorb acids and store them in their bodies with no harm to themselves

As a result, great masses of these creatures were gathered and bred for use as weapons against fiends in the Blood War. After being fed a steady diet of acid for a few days, the sponges are harvested, dried, and covered with a resin that keeps a soft bubble around the sponge. The sponge is then mounted on the head of an arrow or crossbow bolt and is ready for use

When the tip of the bolt strikes a creature with sufficient force, the resin bubble bursts, the sponge flattens, and the target is doused with acid.~

Speed: 10
Weight: 0
Proficiency: Missiles

These crossbow bolts are the work of a twisted mechanical genius. Just beneath the head of each bolt is a small catch, that when pressed, unlocks the head of the bolt, allowing it to divide. From what you can tell, once the bolts are unlocked, the pyramid-shaped heads are carefully fashioned so that each one splits into three on impact. Each triangle-shaped fragment then tears a different route through the target's body, wreaking havoc on his internal organs.~

This ability goes just beyond picking pockets, however; when you invoke the tattoo's power, you gain an insight into the mind of the 'mark' from whom the coins were taken, giving you a small experience point bonus as well.

Blur causes the wizard's form to shift and blur, making it much more difficult to attack the caster: It causes all incoming attacks to be made at -3 penalty and grants the wizard +1 on all saving throws.~

This spell steals life from the target and transfers it to you.

When the player touches a non-undead creature, he drains 1-6 hp from the target for every 2 wizard levels he has (2-12 hp for Lvl 4). The damage that he drains is then transferred to the caster and added to their total hp. Any hp over the normal maximum is treated as 'temporary hit points' which will be lost after one hour if not used beforehand (absorbing damage).~

It then explodes with a concussive blast that does 1 pt. of damage / level of the caster within a 3 ft. radius. If a saving throw is made then this concussive damage is negated.

This 'spell' is actually a complex mathematical equation accidentally discovered by the modron, Enoll Eva, while calculating the multiplication factor on various linear algebraic formulas. The results are devastating: This equation allows all subsequent actions to be doubled or duplicated. Hence it was found that during confrontations, all physical or magical attacks were seemingly doubled - dealing twice the amount of damage.

This spell affects a single target. No Saving Throw required. When cast, all subsequent attacks (physical or magical) will be duplicated once: For example, after attacking once with a weapon, the attack will be immediately duplicated - same for spells (cast a Magic Missile, and immediately afterwards, another Magic Missile spell will launch). This spell will last for approximately 2 minutes after casting.~

In an ironic twist, all magic in its area of effect shall be undone, with this spell

This spell surrounds the caster with a 'shell of magic' that effectively negates all magic and magical spell effects (including magic items) within its area of effect. Thus, it blocks out magic, yet it also stops all usage within the shell as well! This also includes various special attacks such as breath, gaze, or voice attacks. The spell lasts for 5 minutes, and the globe's area of effect is 1 foot per level of the caster.~

Similar to its sister spell, Antimagic Shell, this enchantment restricts certain magic from entering its confines. Yet unlike its sibling, this spell allows magic to flow outward from within

This spell creates an immobile sphere of magic that prevents any 1st - 4th level spell effects from penetrating (even area effect spells). Spells of 5th level or higher are not affected by the globe. But unlike Antimagic Shell, any type of spell can be cast out of the sphere. The globe lasts for 5 seconds per level of the caster.~

As the River Styx flows through the Stygian Ice, so it does in this spell as well. Perhaps if the victims are strong enough to survive this devastation they may live to tell others about the true terror... but the River Styx has a tendency to make people forget

Ice from Stygia is summoned to crush all creatures within sight for 8-64 pts. of ice damage, with no saving throw. Finally, all creatures must save vs. spell or suffer confusion for 5-30 seconds due to the immediate contact with the frozen, forgetful waters of the River Styx.~

When compared to the tanar'ri, at least the baatezu are more civilized. There is, perhaps, nothing more horrific than the unbounded fury of the Abyss. By use of this spell, the ground shall split open and the victim dragged into the tanar'rian madness. Welcome to Hell.

This spell opens a planar portal beneath a specified victim and drags them down into the Abyss. The portal remains open even after the victim is swallowed in. The only sound bystanders hear is the incessant screaming of the victim as he/she is torn apart by the ruthless tanar'ri. After what seems like only a few seconds (which is more than an eternity for the victim in the Abyss), the victim (or what's left of him) gets spit back out of the portal

(1) If the victim makes a successful saving throw, he will get spit out of the portal in 'one piece,' but while the victim sensed nothing at first, after a split second, all the wrath of the tanar'ri will surface. The victim will suffer 5d10 pts. of damage as he suffers multiple 'delayed' attacks and slashes from all angles

(2) If the victim fails the saving throw, it is instant death. All that is left are body parts.~

On the githzerai's home plane of Limbo, solid matter is something of a rarity. Limbo itself is a soupy mass of elements, and only through force of will can the githzerai shape these elements into stable matter

A substance called *karach* is a material that can be shaped with the mind. Dak'kon's blade is composed of this substance; through mental discipline alone, Dak'kon maintains the integrity of the blade. When the spirit and discipline of the user begin to falter, the blade itself will react, mirroring the wielder's thoughts

Dak'kon must be suffering indeed, for his *karach* blade has become a dead flat black, mirroring Dak'kon's eyes. It has become longer, sharper, and a series of subtle jags, like teeth, now line the edge of the blade.

This blade appears to have special religious significance for Dak'kon. Dak'kon has wound a series of parchments around the hilt of the blade. These appear to be mantras dedicated to Zerthimon.~

Their essence is still that of harmony and goodness, and they can only be employed by a creature whose heart is filled with good intentions.

The kaleidoscopic eye can either be wielded in the hand or placed in an empty eye socket, depending on whether its owner wishes to use it for defense or offense. When held, the user may summon its power to harness ambient light, twist it, then turn it against his enemies

When placed in the owner's eye socket, the eye grafts itself to the wearer's skull and helps shield its new owner. It absorbs a portion of the energies from incoming attacks and provides proof against all manner of magical attacks

When the Kaleidoscopic Eye's offensive power is exhausted, it cracks and turns to dust.~

Usable only by Dak'kon

This strange blade has become a brilliant silver. It seems as if the blade has become longer than when you first saw it, and it no longer has the same strange shimmering surface it once did. The edge of the blade tapers almost to a paper-thin line - despite its flimsy appearance, it looks like it could cut through chain armor with ease. In addition, the blade itself seems much faster... it seems to *flow* as Dak'kon swings it through the air

This blade appears to have special religious significance for Dak'kon. He has wound a series of parchments around the hilt of the blade. These appear to be mantras dedicated to Zerthimon.~

On the githzerai's home plane of Limbo, solid matter is something of a rarity. Limbo itself is a soupy mass of elements, and only through force of will can the githzerai shape these elements into stable matter

A substance called "karach" is a material that can be shaped with the mind. Dak'kon's blade is composed of this substance; through mental discipline alone, Dak'kon maintains the integrity of the blade. When the user's spirit is focused, his mind clear of doubts and devoted to a single purpose, the blade itself will react, mirroring the wielder's thoughts

If so, Dak'kon's mind must be clear, indeed, for his blade has become a brilliant silver. It seems as if the blade has become longer than when you first saw it, and there is no trace of the strange shimmering surface it once had.

Long are the debates about the spectrum of color in the multiverse. "This Blue is better than Yellow!" "Pike it, berk! Of course White is the true color!" And while in the end, many generally agree that a color's greatness is in the eye of the beholder, this spell establishes the fact that some colors are deadlier than others

As per the name, this spell will magically pacify 2-8 creatures of 6 HD or less in the area of effect; this affects all types of creatures except for undead. When cast, creatures must immediately make a saving throw vs. spell. If they fail, they stop all activities that require any exertion, including arguments, combat, etc. From here, the affected creatures will fall into a deep slumber.

The damage that he drains is then transferred to the caster and added to their total hp.

At first glance, this glass eye seems a poor replacement for a real one. However, when inserted into an empty eye socket facing inwards, its power awakens

Although the eye dulls the wearer to colors and sights, it increases his awareness of angles and shapes, giving the wearer greater accuracy with weapons and giving him a greater chance of dodging incoming missile attacks. Furthermore, mechanical traps stand out to the wearer's vision, making it easier to spot and disarm them.

The user becomes more vulnerable to crushing attacks, however - some of the fragility of the glass eye seems to be transferred to its wearer.~

It then explodes with a concussive blast that does 1 pt. of damage / level of the caster within a 3 ft. radius. If a saving throw is made then this concussive damage is negated.

Saving Throw: None

This 'spell' is actually a complex mathematical equation accidentally discovered by the modron, Enoll Eva, while calculating the multiplication factor on various linear algebraic formulas. The results are devastating: This equation allows all subsequent actions to be doubled or duplicated. Hence it was found that during confrontations, all physical or magical attacks were seemingly doubled - dealing twice the amount of damage.

This spell affects a single target. No Saving Throw required. When cast, all subsequent attacks (physical or magical) will be duplicated once: For example, after attacking once with a weapon, the attack will be immediately duplicated - same for spells (cast a Magic Missile, and immediately afterwards, another Magic Missile spell will launch). This spell will last for approximately 2 minutes after casting.~

This spell surrounds the caster with a 'shell of magic' that effectively negates all magic and magical spell effects (including magic items) within its area of effect. Thus, it blocks out magic, yet it also stops all usage within the shell as well! This also includes various special attacks such as breath, gaze, or voice attacks.

This spell creates an immobile sphere of magic that prevents any 1st - 4th level spell effects from penetrating (even area effect spells). Spells of 5th level or higher are not affected by the globe. But unlike Antimagic Shell, any type of spell can be cast out of the sphere. The globe lasts for 5 seconds per level of the caster.~

Creatures of 2HD or less who fail a saving throw vs. spell are incapacitated for 10 - 60 minutes.

As the River Styx flows through the Stygian Ice, so it does in this spell as well. Perhaps if the victims are strong enough to survive this devastation they may live to tell others about the true terror... but the River Styx has a tendency to make people forget

Ice from Stygia is summoned to crush all creatures within sight for 8-64 pts. of ice damage, with no saving throw. Finally, all creatures must save vs. spell or suffer confusion for 5-30 seconds due to the immediate contact with the frozen, forgetful waters of the River Styx.~

This powerful lens heightens the perceptions and the thoughts of the wearer when worn. It grants the wearer enhanced deduction abilities, the knowledge of spell-casting (and how to thwart it), and also gives any missile attack greater range and damage.~

This snap-on magnifying lens gives the wearer the ability to see a few seconds into the future, allowing them to anticipate where an opponent will be and dodge incoming attacks. Archers and snipers will have a maddeningly hard time trying to pin down anyone wearing this lens.~

This scope looks as if it's missing its lens, but in fact, the lens itself is displaced in space: if you use your peripheral vision, you can make it out a few feet to your left, just hanging in space

When this scope is equipped, a portion of the wearer phases out, and he becomes EXTREMELY difficult to hit with missile weapons or spells. Furthermore, the wearer is just hard to see, period; it's almost like he's not all there. Depending on who's wearing this lens, it may complement his personality just fine.~

Usably only by Modrons

Whether a joke or the result of a bizarre experiment, some insane machinist dabbling in the Art has crafted a lens that "gifts" the user with the vision of a bat. The inventor must have wanted to force the user to appreciate the perspective, as the lens cannot be removed without a Remove Curse spell.~

Special: +2 to Armor Class

Usable only by Modrons

This bizarre bubble shaped scope has two lenses mounted side by side. When looking through it, everything appears double, which makes it difficult to distinguish which target is the real one

The benefit of the lens, however, is any projectile the user fires at a target IS doubled while he is wearing the lens. When equipped, any projectile fired by the lens-wearer splits into two, doubling its damage.~

Legend has it that this bracelet was created by Nacek the Sadistic. Tiny razor sharp spikes cover the entire surface of this item injecting small amounts of rare reagents into the blood stream of the user.

This damage affects any creature within the 10 foot radius of where the bolt crashes down. Area of Effect is a 10 feet Radius. A Save vs. Spells results in half-damage. This spell can only be used outdoors.~

Range: 150 feet
Duration: 5 seconds per 3 levels
Speed: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

It is said an adder's kiss can scald even the most fearsome of fiends. This spell calls forth an acidic bolt to shower an opponent with its vile green acid. If the caster is skilled enough, the adder's kiss lingers after the initial strike, continuing to sink into an opponent's skin with its acidic teeth.

When cast, the caster chooses any target within 150 ft. and the Adder's Kiss will strike for 2-8 hit points of acid damage. For every three levels of the caster, the acid lasts 5 seconds longer, inflicting another 2-8 points of acid damage / 5 second segments.~

Weight: 0
Proficiency: Missiles

Also called "Kessek's Teeth," the head of these enchanted bolts are made of bone and have two long fangs curving out from the center. When one of these bolts strikes an opponent, the fangs takes on a life of their own and begin eating their way slowly and painfully through the victim's body

According to legend, Kessek was a bariaur chieftain on the Outlands who was forced to watch his people starve during a winter storm in the Cleft of Tears many centuries ago. Trapped in the Cleft because of heavy snows, he sent scouts from his tribe out to seek aid from his neighbors, the province of Ohinru

Learning of the bariaurs' plight, the merchant princes of Ohinru saw an opportunity to wipe out the "nomadic pests" and claim their lands for their own. The bariaur scouts were executed and their heads mounted on the walls so that, "the vultures might feed while the bariaurs starved."

When the storms cleared and more than half of his tribe had died of starvation, Kessek finally learned what had happened to his scouts. Consumed with an insane fire, he fashioned a sheaf of bolts from the teeth and bones of his people who had starved to death. Once he had finished, he traveled to Ohinru in the night and fired his bolts blindly in the city streets, the name of each bariaur that had died whispered on his lips as he released each shaft

Each bolt he fired twisted in flight, hungrily searching for a victim and each found one... then another, then another. The night was filled with the choked screams of the citizens of Ohinru as the devourers claimed their bodies

When dawn touched the city, the vultures fed again. No trace of Kessek could be found.

The bolts of Kessek the Devourer can still be found scattered across the planes. It is said that for each victim the bolts claim, that another bolt is born... with the same hunger as the first.~

This is the scorched remains of your eye, blistered by Ignus' touch. Ignus has hinted that this charred remain of your eye somehow holds a fraction of his infernal power... now passed on to you

To invoke its power, you must crush the blackened eyeball between both your hands, then take the ashes and touch them to each eyelid. Doing so will transfer a small portion of Ignus' arcane knowledge to you, giving you the knowledge of how to show others brief, terrible glimpses of the elemental forces Ignus draws upon.

THAC0: +1

Proficiency: Axes
Usable only by Fighters

This magnificent axe, known as "Blindsider," is truly one of a kind. It is rumored that it was the creation of one Akyzum Yar, chief metallurgist of an ancient empire on the Prime Material Plane. The Emperor whom Yar served, a vain and wicked man, commissioned the creation of "a weapon of unsurpassed beauty." After years of toiling, Yar succeeded and presented the Emperor with "Blindsider," whereupon he was promptly put to death so that his work could never be reproduced

The various ores and enchantments employed in the forging of this weapon yielded a new type of metal that is lightweight, durable, and highly reflective. The axe earned its name from its tendency to reflect light into the eyes of its opponent, temporarily blinding the target so that its wielder can easily cut him down. Additionally, its wielder is granted immunity to blinding attacks as a magical byproduct of its reflective nature.~

This giant, axe-like cleaver earned its nickname while in the hands of Oswell Breck, a butcher who once serviced the Clerk's Ward of Sigil. The chant is that one day this affable and well-respected citizen suddenly went on a murderous and bloody rampage that lasted ten days and ten nights. Cleaver in hand, Oswell stalked the streets of the ward, brutally hacking down every man, woman, and child unlucky enough to cross his path until the Lady herself intervened. It is rumored that he suffered from a strange disease that slowly caused his body to waste away, and it was this disease that eroded his sanity and prompted the murder spree.

The origin of this instrument of carnage is shrouded in mystery. However, the various wizards and scholars who examined the discarded weapon after Oswell's mazing have catalogued the nature of its enchantment. The cleaver seems to feed upon its victims, sucking the very life force from them and bestowing a portion of it upon its wielder.~

(Minor Artifact)
Special: Teaches User "Enoll Eva's Duplication"
Weight: 2
Usable only by Mages

The heavy gear that lies in the middle of this twisted mass of junk holds the last algebraic ruminations of Enoll Eva, the recently disintegrated Creative Director of Rubikon. Inscribed upon this twisted gear is a complex mathematical equation the modron discovered while attempting to calculate the permutations of the Rubikon maze. It is likely the presence of Limbo had an impact on his thoughts, inspiring the narrow-minded modron to think of something both brilliant and extremely dangerous.

Once "calculated" (cast), Enoll Eva's equation allows all subsequent actions to be doubled or duplicated. During confrontations, all physical or magical attacks are doubled - dealing twice the amount of damage.

How it ended up inside Nordom's frame is unknown, but the rogue modron may have picked it up while gathering wayward items in the Rubikon maze.~

"Celestial Fire" was the only object that Trias had left to remind him of the Upper Planes. The blade became a pair of gauntlets in your hands. They are warm to the touch, and flames have been carved across the knuckles of the gloves. The intricacy of the carvings is breathtaking; they are done with such skill that the gauntlets seem to be burning with metallic flames... someone must have spent several centuries rendering them. The metal of the gauntlets is unfamiliar... it is heavy, but it shines like silver.

The gauntlets look several millennia old. A faint hum can be felt within them, and the vibration becomes stronger when they touch human flesh. Not surprisingly, the "Gauntlets of Celestial Fire" can be wielded only by those with sufficient strength and purity of heart. When used in combat, the "Gauntlets of Celestial Fire" burst into a holy radiance that burns any evil creature they strike in combat.~

This strange item was in your possession after you gave the Modron Cube to the iron golem in the Siege Tower. It looks to be a small dagger, but its surface twists and bends as you watch, as if struggling to break free from its shape

It looks to be made of iron, silver, and any of a number of different metals. Sometimes they blend together, other times, they submerge into the core of the blade, only to resurface again minutes later.~

- If the Contracted workers could be inspected every eight hours and Raised if they have collapsed, then this would prevent the backlog of shells in the Preparation Rooms and free up more Contracted workers for other duties

- I do not wish collapsed bodies to be disposed of; when possible, the original Contracted shells are to be Raised and be made to resume their duties

The crimes the lost incarnation committed eventually drove him to seek shelter in the Weeping Stone catacombs, where he survived for almost a year

When worn, the tattoo seems to bring out a survival instinct in you, forcing your body to react to any damage you take and heal wounds faster

If you choose to tap into the tattoo's power, some of the memories of hiding beneath Sigil will return to you, giving you the benefit of the previous incarnation's experience. It can only do this once, but even after the tattoo is invoked, the increased regeneration rate will remain.~

When worn, the tattoo makes concealing yourself easier; it allows you to shape the shadows around you like a cloak. This makes it harder for your enemies to hurt you when they see you and harder for you to find when you don't wish to be seen. It lends you a sinister appearance, however, which will cause many to shun you.

If you choose to tap into the tattoo's power, some of the memories of hiding beneath Sigil will return to you, giving you the benefit of the previous incarnation's experience. It can only do this once, but even after the tattoo is invoked, the ability to shape shadows around you will remain.~

This tattoo came from the severed arm you found in the Dismembered Crypt. Apparently, this tattoo tells of the experiences of one of your past incarnations... the symbols and tales are unfamiliar to you, but it seems to tell of a time when the catacombs beneath Sigil's streets were your second home. It tells of you travelling down into the tombs, living in darkness, and coming to learn the nature of why the stones beneath Sigil weep

When worn, the tattoo makes you more resilient to cold and hardens your body, giving your skin the texture and strength of the weeping stone walls. In so doing, however, it also gives you a hungry gaunt look, as if you are starving.

If you choose to tap into the tattoo's power, some of the memories of living beneath Sigil will return to you, giving you the benefit of the previous incarnation's experience. It can only do this once, but even after the tattoo is invoked, the resistance to cold and the bonus to your armor class will remain.~

This tattoo came from the severed arm you found in the Dismembered Crypt. Apparently, this tattoo tells of the experiences of one of your past incarnations... the symbols and tales are unfamiliar to you, but it seems to tell of a time when you lived as a thief on Sigil's streets, before being driven down into the catacombs because of your thieving nature

In activating the tattoo, some of the memories of living on Sigil's streets will return to you, giving you more experience. Furthermore, it will give you a permanent bonus to your pick pocket skill. Even when the tattoo is invoked and the experience has been gained, however, the tattoo and the pick pocket bonus will remain.~

On the githzerai's home plane of Limbo, solid matter is something of a rarity. Limbo itself is a soupy mass of elements, and only through force of will can the githzerai shape these elements into stable matter

A substance called *karach* is a material that can be shaped with the mind. Dak'kon's blade is composed of this substance; through mental discipline alone, Dak'kon maintains the integrity of the blade. When the spirit and discipline of the user begin to falter, the blade itself will react, mirroring the wielder's thoughts

Dak'kon must be suffering indeed, for his *karach* blade has become a dead flat black, mirroring Dak'kon's eyes. It has become longer, sharper, and a series of subtle jags, like teeth, now line the edge of the blade.

This blade appears to have special religious significance for Dak'kon. Dak'kon has wound a series of parchments around the hilt of the blade. These appear to be mantras dedicated to Zerthimon.~

A substance called "karach" is a material that can be shaped with the mind.

When the user's spirit is focused, his mind clear of doubts and devoted to a single purpose, the blade itself will react, mirroring the wielder's thoughts

If so, Dak'kon's mind must be clear, indeed, for his blade has become a brilliant silver. It seems as if the blade has become longer than when you first saw it, and there is no trace of the strange shimmering surface it once had. The edge of the blade tapers almost to a paper-thin line - despite its flimsy appearance, it looks like it could cut through chain armor with ease.

On the githzerai's home plane of Limbo, solid matter is something of a rarity. Limbo itself is a soupy mass of elements, and only through force of will can the githzerai shape these elements into stable matter

A substance called "karach" is a material that can be shaped with the mind. Dak'kon's blade is composed of this substance; through mental discipline alone, Dak'kon maintains the integrity of the blade. He can shape it slightly depending on his skill, adjusting its length, sharpness of the edge. Presumably as he gains levels, he may be able to manipulate the blade in new ways

It is not known whether all githzerai *zerth* carry such weapons. Certainly a weapon that depends on the integrity of the wielder would be entrusted only to those who had learned to discipline themselves.

This blade appears to have special religious significance for Dak'kon. Dak'kon has wound a series of parchments around the hilt of the blade. These appear to be mantras dedicated to Zerthimon.~

The carrion crawler is a scavenger of subterranean areas, feeding primarily upon carrion. However, when such food becomes scarce or when it is threatened, it will attack and kill living creatures.
The carrion crawler looks like a cross between a giant green cutworm and a cephalopod. Like so many other hybrid monsters, the carrion crawler may well be the result of genetic experimentation by a mad, evil wizard
The monster's head is covered with a tough hide, but the body is not well protected. The monster is accompanied by a rank, fetid odor which often gives warning of its approach.~

Elves are looked upon as being frivolous and aloof. They concern themselves with natural beauty, dancing, frolicking, and other similar pursuits. Their humor is clever, as are their songs and poetry. There are six racial divisions of elves within the realms: gold elves, moon elves, wild elves, sea elves, dark elves (drow), and winged elves (avariel).
Elves have the following traits:
— 90% resistance against charm and sleep magics.
— Infravision.
— +1 THAC0 bonus with bows, short swords, and long swords.
— -5% Open Locks, +5% Pick Pockets, +5% Move Silently, +10% Hide in Shadows

They come screaming, jabbering, and howling out of the night. Dozens, maybe hundreds, of hunchbacked, naked humanoids swarm unceasingly forward. They have no thought of safety, subtlety, or strategy, leaving others with no hope of stopping their mass assault. Then, having come and killed, the gibberlings move on, seemingly randomly, back into the night.
The first impression of gibberlings is of a writhing mass of fur and flesh in the distant moonlit darkness. The pandemonium is actually a mass of pale, hunchbacked humanoids, with pointed canine ears and black manes surrounding their hideous, grinning faces. Their black eyes shine with a maniacal gleam.~

@68872 = ~MONK: Monks are warriors who pursue perfection through contemplation as well as action. They are versatile fighters, especially skilled in combat without weapons or armor. Though Monks cannot cast spells, they have a unique magic of their own: they channel a subtle energy, called ki, which allows them to perform amazing feats. The Monk's best known feat is their ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow.
