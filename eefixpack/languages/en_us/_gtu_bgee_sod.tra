// this will form the basis for the GTU for this game. Simply add strings as needed and the installer will replace 
// the corresponding string in the tlk. Remember to comment why a string is being updated. Once you have legitimate
// strings to replace, rename this file WITHOUT the underscore at the beginning. 

// any strings < 34000 are non-sod strings and should go into the gtu_bgee.tra file instead. 

// strref #34567, updating because "X is misspelled"
