// monk AC bonus progression changes at levels 23 and 35
@24234 = ~MONK: Monks are warriors who pursue perfection through contemplation as well as action. They are versatile fighters, especially skilled in combat without weapons or armor. Though Monks cannot cast spells, they have a unique magic of their own: They channel a subtle energy, called ki, which allows them to perform amazing feats. The Monk's best known feat is their ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow.

– May only use weapons available to the Thief class (except two-handed).
– May only become Proficient (one slot) in any weapon class.
– May only become Proficient (one slot) in Single-Weapon Style and may not put slots into any other style.
– Moves 2 points faster than other characters. Movement rate further improves by 1 every 5 levels.
– May make 1 unarmed attack per round. An additional 1/2 attack per round is gained every 3 levels. Damage dealt by unarmed attacks increases with level as follows:

  Level 6-8: 1d10
  Level 9-14: 1d12
  Level 15+: 1d20

– 20th level: Becomes immune to non-magical weapons.
– Alignment restricted to lawful.

// archer's hit/damage bonuses change after level 18
@24298 = ~ARCHER: The Archer is the epitome of skill with the bow—the ultimate marks<PRO_MANWOMAN>, able to make almost any shot, no matter how difficult. To become so skilled with the bow, the Archer has had to sacrifice some of <PRO_HISHER> proficiency with melee weapons and armor.

Advantages:
– +1 to hit and damage rolls with any missile weapon every 3 levels through level 18.
– +1 to hit and damage rolls with any missile weapon every 5 levels from level 23 onwards.

CALLED SHOT: All successful ranged attacks within the next 10 seconds have the following cumulative effects besides normal damage, according to the level of the Archer:
 4th level: -1 penalty to target's THAC0.
 8th level: -1 penalty to target's Saving Throws vs. Spell.
 12th level: -1 penalty to the target's Strength score.
 16th level: +2 bonus to damage roll.

– May only wear leather, studded leather, and hide armor.
– May only become Proficient (one slot) with melee weapons.
– May not use the Charm Animal ability.~

// radius is actually 10'
@25825 = ~Protection From Evil, 10' Radius
(Abjuration)

Level: 4
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 10-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, all allied creatures within a 10-ft. radius are affected individually by Protection From Evil. It creates a magical barrier around the recipients at a distance of one foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has two major effects: First, all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures against the protected creature receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll. Second, summoned demons cannot target protected creatures.~

// shield of the archons cannot be dispelled, but it also doesn't absorb dispel - just use strref 15965 from iwdee
@26287 = ~Shield of the Archons
(Abjuration)

Level: 7
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This powerful abjuration spell causes the spells cast against the priest to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total number of spell levels equal to half the level of the caster. It includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes area effects that are not centered directly upon the priest and area effects that are stationary, such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud.

As long as there are levels remaining, the spell will be absorbed. For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the priest, the spell will be absorbed while canceling the shield.

This spell will not protect the caster from Dispel Magic, but it will not be dispelled by Dispel Magic either.~

// cone of cold's AoE is 18 ft long, not 17
@26493 = ~Cone of Cold
(Evocation)

Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 18-ft. cone with 90-deg. arc
Saving Throw: 1/2

When this spell is cast, it generates a cone-shaped area of extreme cold originating at the wizard's hand and extending outward in a cone 18 ft. long with a 90-deg. arc. It drains heat and causes 1d4+1 points of damage per level of the caster. For example, a 10th-level wizard would cast a cone of cold causing 10d4+10 points of damage.~

// second sentence in description said "1d2 carrion crawlers", but actually it's a 35/65 split. Changed to a more general "one or two carrion crawlers"
// same fix required for bg (26586), bg2 (29212), and iwd (35784)
@26586 = ~Carrion Summons
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 6
Range: 120 ft.
Duration: 7 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

There are two parts to this spell. First, a small portal opens and summons one or two carrion crawlers to a point designated by the wizard. Second, the magic mutates the carrion crawlers into larger, more vicious versions of themselves. The wizard now has control over these creature(s) until they are slain or the spell's duration expires. There is a 35% chance that two carrion crawlers will be summoned instead of one.~

// using iwdee's summon nishruu; see @35786 in your local copy_from_iwdee.tra
@26588 = ~Summon Nishruu
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 6
Range: 25 ft.
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By casting Summon Nishruu, a wizard calls into existence a magical being of considerable power: the nishruu. At first glance, this appears to be some sort of mist, but upon closer examination, this boiling, churning gray mass of vapors and shapes moves with a life of its own. Drawn toward magic like a moth to the flame, the nishruu feeds on the energies surrounding and used by wizards. Luckily, there is no question as to the loyalty of the creature, and it will not attack its summoner even though it would like nothing better.

The nishruu has no physical attacks at all, although physical attacks can hurt it. Each time a nishruu touches a target wizard and wraps its tendrils around <PRO_HIMHER>, two things happen: First, all magical items with charges in the possession of the target will be drained by 1 charge, destroying them if only 1 charge was left; second, the wizard loses 1 random spell of the highest level currently memorized. The nishruu is completely immune to energy damage, and magic will actually heal it. The creature will remain under the wizard's control until slain or until the spell's duration expires.~

// remove the line about the save penalty for water/plants since it's not implemented
@26646 = ~Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting
(Necromancy)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell evaporates moisture from the bodies of every living creature within the area of effect, inflicting 1d8 damage per level of the caster. Affected creatures are allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell for half damage. This spell will not harm party members.~

// sun soulbeam does not roll an attack, just acts as a normal spell--deleted relevant sentence. (see also 32224)
@31984 = ~SUN SOUL MONK: Sun Soul Monks were once worshippers of Amaunator in the time of the Netheril, but today their worship is divided between Lathander, Selûne, and Sune. Sun Soul Monks adhere strictly to the law, using their martial arts and magical abilities to drive out darkness and corruption wherever they find it.

Advantages:
– 2nd level: May cast Sun Soulray once per day.

SUN SOULRAY: The Sun Soul Monk projects a blast of light from <PRO_HISHER> open palm, dealing 1d8 fire damage for every 2 caster levels (up to a maximum of 5d8 damage) to a single target. Undead creatures take an additional 6 points of damage.

– 5th level: May cast Flaming Fists once per day.

FLAMING FISTS: The Sun Soul Monk channels <PRO_HISHER> inner light into <PRO_HISHER> unarmed attacks, turning <PRO_HISHER> fists into flaming weapons that deal an additional 2d6 fire damage per hit for the next round. The duration increases to 2 rounds at level 9, 3 rounds at level 12, 4 rounds at level 15, and 5 rounds at level 25. This special ability automatically modifies normal attacks; no weapon-switching needs to be done.

– 6th level: Gains an additional use of Sun Soulray.
– 8th level: May cast Greater Sun once per day.

GREATER SUN: The Sun Soul Monk wreathes <PRO_HIMHER>self in flames that act as a Fireshield (Red), granting the Monk 50% Fire Resistance and protecting <PRO_HIMHER> from attacks made within a 5-ft. radius. An opponent that hits the Monk with any weapons or spells within this radius suffers 1d8+2 points of fire damage.

– 10th level: Gains an additional use of Sun Soulray.
– 13th level: May cast Sun Soulbeam once per day.

SUN SOULBEAM: The Sun Soul Monk emits a dazzling burst of light that strikes at all other creatures within a 15-ft. radius. Struck creatures suffer 9d6 points of fire damage (9d6+3 if undead), unless they save vs. Spell for half. In addition, all creatures except the Monk must save vs. Spell or be blinded for 2 hours.

– 15th level: Gains an additional use of Sun Soulray.

Disadvantages:
– Alignment restricted to lawful good.
– May not use Stunning Blow ability.
– May not use Quivering Palm ability.~

// sun soulbeam does not roll an attack, just acts as a normal spell--deleted relevant sentence. (see also 31984)
@32224 = ~Sun Soulbeam
The character emits a dazzling burst of light that strikes at all other creatures within a 15-ft. radius. Struck creatures suffer 9d6 points of fire damage (9d6+3 if undead), unless they save vs. Spell for half. In addition, all creatures except the character must save vs. Spell or be blinded for 2 hours.~

// ranger charm animal description doesn't mention the duration of the charm; added the sentence at the end of the first paragraph
@32228 = ~Charm Animal
This spell affects any single animal it is cast upon. The animal is allowed a Save vs. Spell to negate the effect. The charm lasts for two turns.

If the spell's recipient fails its Saving Throw, it regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give it orders, and the charmed animal will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harms—or attempts to harm—the charmed animal by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed animal, the spell is broken. If two or more charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence. Note that the subject will be hostile when the charm expires, regardless of its original attitude. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where it was charmed.~
