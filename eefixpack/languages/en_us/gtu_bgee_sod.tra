When Tip finally died at the age of one hundred and three, he left his favorite belt to his son, who discovered that the belt buckle had caught a four-leaf clover in the clasp. Whether Tip had placed the clover there himself, or whether it had simply been stuck there after a tumble down a hill in his youth, no one will ever know. What is known is that Tip’s fortune passed down to his son, until the belt was stolen from him by an ogre while he was traveling along the Sword Coast.

As the dawn's rosy light flooded the forest, the blade shimmered into being atop a flat stone. Local foresters, even warriors, were afraid to touch the weapon lest it was cursed. Finally, a brave old man who had been a fighter in his youth grasped the hilt and claimed the blade as its own. Terrifying beasts sprang at him a moment later, creatures of red mist and fangs and claws. The old man clung to his courage and lay about him with the sword. He grew faster with every monster he killed until finally the clearing was empty. The old man was feasted in the village for days and then set off to live his final years seeking adventure on the road.

(Conjuration)

Level: 4
Sphere: Summoning
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

As the Shaman casts this spell, energies gather together from the spirit world and form a pale blue sphere. The Shaman can throw the sphere so that it explodes into a burst of ghostly, azure flames, which deliver 1d4 points of magic damage per level of the Shaman (up to a maximum of 10d4). There is also a 33% chance that every enemy within the area of effect will be afflicted by the Doom spell (-2 penalty to Saving Throws and attack rolls for 1 turn). A successful Save vs. Spell halves the damage and negates the Doom effect. Spirits, fey creatures, elementals, and spectral undead take double damage.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 6
@35363 = ~Ether Gate
(Alteration)

Level: 7
Sphere: Travelers
Range: Touch
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell transports one creature, chosen by the caster, to the Ethereal Plane. The creature vanishes for the spell's duration, at which point it returns to the physical world in the exact same spot where it was before. While in the Ethereal Plane, the victim cannot interact with anyone or anything that resides on the Prime Material Plane. There is no saving throw against this spell, though it is subject to magic resistance. Friendly creatures can lower their magic resistance so that the shaman can target them with this spell. In addition, Ether Gate is blocked by spells and abilities that protect against maze effects.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35584 = ~Good. I'd like to explore the area, make sure we don't have any unpleasant surprises.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35585 = ~What now?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35586 = ~The camp's a waste of time. We should ride till we reach Bridgefort.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35587 = ~Wandering off on your own? I don't like it. We already know Caelar's got a target on your back.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35588 = ~I won't be alone. I'll have you with me.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35589 = ~I won't be alone.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35590 = ~You don't like it? Come with me, then.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35591 = ~You don't like it? Come with us, then. I could use a good archer.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35592 = ~All the more reason for that back to keep moving.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35593 = ~What you don't like matters little to me.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35595 = ~But if we're going to do this at all, we should get on with it. Let's go.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35596 = ~I'm not finding that terribly comforting.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35597 = ~I'll be careful.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35598 = ~You've lived with worse.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35599 = ~Deal with it. I don't answer to you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35600 = ~You better be. Eltan'll have my head if anything untoward happens to you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35601 = ~Just be careful. Lord Eltan will have me drawn and quartered if the hero of Baldur's Gate is killed on my watch.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35603 = ~That, I like.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35604 = ~We rest, then move on to the bridge.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35605 = ~I'm not feeling particularly restful. Perhaps I'll explore the area.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35606 = ~I'll go mad if I'm stuck sitting in this camp. There must be something I can do.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35607 = ~Time spent here is time wasted. We should move on through the night.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35608 = ~I've got men gathering firewood, and the less time spent away from camp, the safer everyone will be.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35609 = ~Maybe I will just go rest...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35610 = ~Get firewood! Yes! I can do that!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35611 = ~You're joking, yes? A <PRO_MANWOMAN> of my talents, collecting kindling? No. I'll go explore the area, make sure we don't have any unpleasant surprises.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35613 = ~Look, if you absolutely have to do something, I've got people gathering firewood, and the less time spent away from camp, the safer everyone will be.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35614 = ~Maybe I will just rest.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35616 = ~You're joking, yes? A <PRO_MANWOMAN> of my talents, collecting kindling? No. I'll go explore the area, make sure we don't have any unpleasant surprises.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35619 = ~I can't. I need to move, to do something.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35620 = ~Yeah. I kind of lied about that. Sorry.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35621 = ~I changed my mind. If you've a problem with that, I suggest you deal with it.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35622 = ~Fine.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35631 = ~I thought we were trying to avoid the crusade, at least till we reach Bridgefort. Did I get that wrong?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35632 = ~That's it. We're heading back to camp. Let's go.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35633 = ~Good call. We don't want to engage the crusade without all our forces behind us.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35634 = ~Don't be so hasty. I want to see what they're up to.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35635 = ~Yes. After we destroy this blockade.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35636 = ~Now! Take them!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35637 = ~Hold the line!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35644 = ~The champion of Baldur's Gate. And woe betide any who stand in my way.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35647 = ~We can't stand against <PRO_HIMHER>! Fall back!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35649 = ~You're right, you're right. Let's go back.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35650 = ~Watch me.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35655 = ~Now! Take them!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35656 = ~Hold the line!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35657 = ~They've got the hero with them!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35658 = ~That's not right. Fall back!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35659 = ~You heard her! Fall back! Back, across the bridge!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35662 = ~You really don't want to know.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35663 = ~The hero of Baldur's Gate. And if you block my passage, grim tidings await.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35665 = ~Take <PRO_HIMHER>!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35666 = ~We can't stand against <PRO_HIMHER>! Fall back!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35667 = ~If you're not here to pledge your support to the crusade, begone.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35668 = ~And if I were here to offer my services to the crusade?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35669 = ~I can't do that. Either one, pledge my support or begone. Sorry.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35670 = ~I'll send you into the light, you wretch!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35671 = ~We are attacked!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35674 = ~Retreat! Retreat!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35676 = ~Put all your weapons on the ground. Magic trinkets too. Armor, everything.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35677 = ~I cannot do that.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35678 = ~That's not going to happen.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35679 = ~I'll put you in the ground, you mindless parakeet!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35680 = ~This—this is a terrible way to treat a bridge. Or any river crossing!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35681 = ~Wow. Did you see that? That—that was something, don't you think?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35683 = ~I always have enjoyed a good fireworks display.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35696 = ~Just—caution. Try having some for a change.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35697 = ~I'll be careful.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35698 = ~Caution is my middle name. I assume my mother was drinking when she came up with that.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35699 = ~Respect. Try showing some where it's due.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35700 = ~Not a good time for jokes, <CHARNAME>.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35701 = ~I think you're wrong, dear lady. If one must face death, it's better to do it with a smile on one's lips, isn't it?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35702 = ~Death? A little overwrought, don't you think? They'll have half a river between them.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35703 = ~Well, if <PRO_HESHE> ISN'T facing death, I see no harm in having a laugh, do you?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35705 = ~But not an evil laugh! Boo has no time for those!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35706 = ~A chance to do what? Give the person who tried to have you killed another shot?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35708 = ~NOT FROM MY HAND OR ANY OF THOSE WHO FOLLOW ME.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35710 = ~And that's Captain Corwin, put in her place.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35725 = ~There is not a shred of doubt in her, only clarity, certainty of her actions. Would that I had that strength.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35728 = ~While we breed poisons below, we keep them to our blades. These surface poisons... faith and righteousness... you keep them on the tongue, making every word deadly.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35732 = ~Banners burn, sheep flee, and would-be prophets who overstep themselves die.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35738 = ~I'd rather be wanted than had. Something about this smells funny.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35739 = ~I don't see that we have much choice but to proceed to Bridgefort.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35740 = ~Funny amusing, or funny I'm-going-to-regret-making-this-journey-if-I-live-long-enough-to-have-regrets?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35741 = ~What would you have us do? Run cowering back to Baldur's Gate?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35742 = ~Agreed. Let's get back to the camp.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35745 = ~I'm full of surprises.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35746 = ~I have had enough talk of devotion, it is vengeance I seek.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35754 = ~This is personal. Do not try to deny it.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35756 = ~She will not stop until she is dead. Possibly not even then.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35760 = ~Our orders are clear. Crossing or no crossing, we move on to Bridgefort.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35765 = ~"Ours is not to reason why..."~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35766 = ~Speak for yourself, you purple-faced baboon.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35767 = ~Mind thy tongue, Thayan.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35770 = ~Enough!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35772 = ~You three sort yourselves out or by all the gods, I'll do it myself. And that is something you do not want.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35773 = ~You two sort yourselves out or by all the gods, I'll do it myself. And that is something you do not want.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35774 = ~She's right. I'll not have my allies constantly trying to kill each other. Kill each other now and let this be an end to it.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35776 = ~Good.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35777 = ~Boo says we can manage that...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35778 = ~...Even giant space hamsters make mistakes!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35779 = ~I'll dance on your smoldering corpses, Rashemi scum!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35780 = ~That works for me!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35782 = ~Fair enough.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35783 = ~Boo says we can manage that.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35784 = ~If the great oaf can manage it, we certainly can.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35940 = ~Are you deaf, Corporal?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35954 = ~I demand entry!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35955 = ~Demand all you like. No harm demanding things.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35956 = ~I have goods to sell!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35959 = ~I'm sorry, who are you?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35960 = ~Miracle... turnip juice? This is going to be good.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35961 = ~Looks can be deceiving. Whatever you're selling, I don't want it.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35962 = ~Guard, take this madwoman away.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35969 = ~Wilhelmina Jansen, turnip-juicer extraordinaire!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35970 = ~Yes! Just one sip of my product and you'll regrow limbs, gain blessings from at least three separate deities, and make contact with the dead!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35971 = ~May I have a moment to tell you about the wonders of turnip juice?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35972 = ~Are you... reading from a scroll?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35973 = ~All the time in the world.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35974 = ~No. A definite, steadfast, vehement, and if necessary violent no.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35978 = ~I don't need to! Turnip juice sells itself.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35979 = ~I'll give you a sample! Then you'll see the tremendous power of turnip juice for yourself!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35980 = ~Very well. Sample me.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35981 = ~I'll take a sample, but I won't drink it.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35982 = ~No, thank you. If you're an example of the benefits of turnip juice, they're something I can live without.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35983 = ~You don't need to. Apply the juice to aching and bruised body parts as a natural remedy! Polish steel, silver, and other precious metals with it! Throw it in the eyes of a hated enemy!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35985 = ~I swear to you, it's— What?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35991 = ~It's true! On top of that, four out of five of those who imbibe turnip juice experience a productivity boost of over a hundred and twenty percent!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35992 = ~But wait! There's more!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35993 = ~More? What more could there possibly be?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35994 = ~Gods. Make it stop.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35996 = ~I'd not be much of an adventurer if I didn't test the veracity of the legends. One turnip juice, please.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35997 = ~If I take one, will you stop talking?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35998 = ~For the love of whatever god you worship, please stop.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@35999 = ~The gods, you say? Turnip juice can help you there too! Drinking it more than doubles the chances of divine intervention improving your life.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36001 = ~Hah! See? I told you. A customer. I can stay!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36002 = ~A little turnip juice never hurt anyone. Let her go through the camp and ply her trade.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36003 = ~No, you can't. We have serious business to attend to here. Move along.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36004 = ~You heard <PRO_HIMHER>. Take your tubersauce and shove off.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36005 = ~You haven't heard the last of me! I'll be back! THE TURNIP WILL NOT BE DISRESPECTED!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36006 = ~*sigh* As you will, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36009 = ~What is it?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36011 = ~Moldy papers and other useless junk.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36016 = ~Sorry. As I was TRYING to say, the feather's the next stone on my path to getting THIS guy OUT OF MY HEAD.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36017 = ~Useless to YOU, perhaps. But not to the keenly probing eyes of the Red Wizard...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36020 = ~You can't fit a single feather in your pack? What's taking up all that space?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36025 = ~Light. Easy to carry. Critical element of the potion that'll get this demented loon out of my head.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36028 = ~<CHARNAME>? I know this is silly, but I can't seem to find room for the feather in my pack. Help me out?~

@36041 = ~Are you sure he's real? The voice in your head, I mean.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36045 = ~Ja! With a horde of eight-legged ones. I came across just such a spider journeying back from the Forest of Wyrms.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36047 = ~We all want to go there.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36048 = ~Just draw us a map.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

@36065 = ~A seven-legged spider, you say.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

@36093 = ~Dramatic, huh? All right... here goes nothing...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36116 = ~Well, that should be fun. And by fun, I mean the exact opposite of fun.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36120 = ~I guess not?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36121 = ~I think you already know the answer to that question.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36125 = ~Now there's a thought...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36126 = ~What do you think will happen to Adoy?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36127 = ~Then let's get going.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36132 = ~That does it—this talk is over. I can do that now. BYE.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36134 = ~The Fugue Plane?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36135 = ~Isn't the Fugue Plane where souls go when they die?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36136 = ~How did he get there?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36137 = ~And how would we bring him back?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36140 = ~I guess I'll just have to keep practicing, won't I?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36141 = ~Next time, I'll try harder.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36154 = ~Also very difficult to get to if you're not, you know, dead. Then again, my magic has done some pretty crazy things in the past... I guess it's not totally out of the question.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36157 = ~So where do we start?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36158 = ~And we want to do this because...?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36159 = ~Mountain of Nepenthe. Never heard of it.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36160 = ~You understand this is a distraction from our goal here, right? If we have a chance to help Adoy, fine, but ending Caelar's crusade is the important thing.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36169 = ~I bring word from Caelar. Where is the camp commander?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36170 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, slayer of unwary guards.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36171 = ~You think you want to see the Barghest? Think again. Find the gnoll, Kharm. He'll get you set up.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36172 = ~You have my thanks.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36173 = ~Kharm, you say?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36178 = ~I don't have that much money.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36179 = ~I have nothing to offer Caelar but my service.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36181 = ~Perhaps you have something else you'd be willing to exchange. What do you say, darling?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36182 = ~You disgust me, you wretched little creature.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36183 = ~Not if you were the last man in Faerûn. What am I saying? You'd have to be a man to begin with for that to happen.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36184 = ~I say you just made your last mistake.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36185 = ~Perhaps one of your friends here might have something to exchange. Standing guard for the crusade... it gets lonely, if you get my meaning.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36186 = ~You sicken me.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36187 = ~Let us pass, or I'll see to it your commander finds out you're barring recruits from the crusade.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36188 = ~In about fifteen seconds, you're going to WISH you were alone.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36189 = ~Then I'm afraid you're out of luck.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36191 = ~One of us is.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36193 = ~Aye, but like I say, it's Kharm you'll be talkin' to. Or maybe Munsch.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36194 = ~I'll be on my way, then. Thank you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36195 = ~Where can I find them?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36196 = ~I'll kill them all in due course.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36197 = ~Frigid witch!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36198 = ~I'll gut you like a pig!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36199 = ~No need for that. I was just tryin' to get myself warm...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36201 = ~You'll find Kharm just down the road. If you reach the bridge, you've gone too far.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36202 = ~Back off. You want no part of me, believe me.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36203 = ~Kill them—?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36204 = ~Help! Help! The camp is under attack!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36205 = ~So that's the way you want it, eh? All right. Just remember, we coulda done this the easy way.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36207 = ~You have my thanks.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36213 = ~I'm afraid I can't allow that.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36214 = ~Oi! Jossain! Fetch the Barghest!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36216 = ~Allow? You're telling ME you won't allow— Oh. I get it.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36217 = ~Unfortunately, you're not dealing with Caelar. Not until you make me happy.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36219 = ~You threaten me?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36220 = ~Joining the crusade takes heart. Determination. Commitment.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36222 = ~I see a lot of folk like you, looking to join Caelar. She's been making waves these past months. But it's not as easy as just sayin' "I want in."~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36229 = ~Liam Ensler, sir.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36230 = ~Liann Ensler, sir.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36231 = ~I am <CHARNAME>.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36232 = ~Trouble.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36235 = ~I apologize, sir. I'm just so excited to be here fighting for Caelar.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36239 = ~It's only been a couple days, sir.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36244 = ~Should you?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36247 = ~He did strike me as a bit... difficult, sir.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36250 = ~You know where Munsch is now? He and I are going to have words, we are.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36251 = ~He's over yonder, sir.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36252 = ~I've no idea.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36253 = ~He's in the Nine Hells now. Here, I'll send you to him.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36254 = ~Only if he knows how to talk with the dead.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36258 = ~Talk with the— You're not crusaders!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36260 = ~You know we've managed to breach Bridgefort's outer wall?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36261 = ~You have?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36262 = ~The keep cannot hope to stand against the crusade.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36263 = ~Very interesting. Here's something you may not know: The enemy's managed to breach your ranks.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36264 = ~How long have you been with us?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36265 = ~Not long, sir.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36266 = ~Do you want to chat, or do you want to get to the point?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36267 = ~Slightly longer than you have to live, fool.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36271 = ~A significant risk.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36277 = ~I will, sir.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36280 = ~Slain—?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36281 = ~Yessss... You know I handle new recruitment for the Blinding White battalion, right? And yet, and yet...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36285 = ~If we've taken the breach, wouldn't it be easier to bring our men in there?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36286 = ~I think they'll have a pretty good idea what hit them.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36287 = ~An excellent plan. A pity you'll not live to receive the credit for it.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36292 = ~You're Lieutenant Kharm? I've been looking all over for you. They said you'd give me an assignment.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36295 = ~Oy! I want to speak with Munsch! Where's the frogfiddler hiding?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36296 = ~For a significant reward.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36298 = ~Awright. What's this all about, then?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36299 = ~You are the Barghest?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36300 = ~I bring word from Caelar for the Barghest.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36304 = ~It's not for your ears.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36307 = ~...What's your name again?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36308 = ~I am <CHARNAME>.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36309 = ~Liam Ensler.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36310 = ~Liann Ensler.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36311 = ~Do you really want to spend the last seconds of your miserable life asking stupid questions?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36313 = ~<CHARNAME>? You mean iron crisis <CHARNAME>?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36314 = ~<CHARNAME>? You mean iron crisis <CHARNAME>?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36315 = ~Well, listen up, Ensler—the Barghest is a very busy man. You want to talk to him, you gotta go through me. And you ain't goin' through me.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36316 = ~I'm sorry to have bothered you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36317 = ~We shall see.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36318 = ~And I'm sorry, but I can't let you leave.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36319 = ~Uh-uh. You're not goin' anywhere.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36320 = ~Come with me.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36321 = ~Barghest's busy. I'm Munsch, Delgar Munsch.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36322 = ~I have a message from Caelar for the Barghest.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36323 = ~Who?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36324 = ~Not for long, you aren't.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36327 = ~Let's hear it.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36328 = ~It's not for your ears.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36329 = ~Sorry, friend. I was told to give this to the Barghest and only the Barghest.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36330 = ~I had hoped to give it directly to the Barghest, but your corpse should send the message eloquently enough.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36331 = ~Do you know who I am? Do you know who I am?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36332 = ~I'm Delgar Munsch! I'm the personal assistant to the Barghest's right hand! An' you won't give me your message?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36333 = ~This had best be important.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36334 = ~You are in command?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36335 = ~I bring word from Caelar the Shining Lady.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36336 = ~Very important. I bring a message from Baldur's Gate.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36337 = ~Vichand! You treacherous swine! The moment of your comeuppance is at hand!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36338 = ~That mage behind the Barghest—I recognize her. She was with Caelar at the Trade Way...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36339 = ~Edwin Odesseiron. I thought you dead. It would have been best if you were...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36340 = ~I am the Barghest, commander of the Blinding White battalion.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36341 = ~I have a message for you from Caelar.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36342 = ~Barghests are evil creatures who feast on the flesh of humans. What manner of person would name himself such a thing?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36343 = ~Soon to be the dead commander of the Blinding White battalion.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36344 = ~Treachery! Behind me, Commander—I'll deal with this!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36345 = ~Strike them down.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36346 = ~Do you now? As the Lady Caelar is on the other side of Boareskyr Bridge and Oloneiros here only recently left her company, I find that... unlikely.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36347 = ~That mage behind the Barghest—I recognize her. She was with Caelar at the Trade Way...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36348 = ~Death to Caelar!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36349 = ~Do we really want to know?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36351 = ~That was before I was saved by the light of Caelar. Who are you? Why are you here?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36352 = ~I am <CHARNAME>.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36353 = ~These are the questions that keep me awake at night.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36354 = ~I have a message for you from the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36355 = ~You! Behind me, Commander. I'll deal with this.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36356 = ~As you wish.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36357 = ~You should try a nice cup of warm milk.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36358 = ~I've neither the time nor the patience for this foolishness.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36360 = ~Where are we going?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36361 = ~If I must.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36362 = ~I don't think so.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36363 = ~The waiting room.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36364 = ~We don't have time to wait, <CHARNAME>. People in Bridgefort are getting sick...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36365 = ~I'm afraid you do.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36366 = ~Something about the way you say that makes me think you're not the one who should be afraid right now.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36367 = ~You're no messenger. Take <PRO_HIMHER>!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36368 = ~At last, the time for violence has arrived. Come, crusader! Let Minsc introduce your face to the dirt!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36369 = ~Damn it, <CHARNAME>! He believed you! We almost had a clear shot at the Barghest and you threw it away!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36370 = ~And here we go again...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36371 = ~Munsch! Who've you got with you?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36372 = ~A messenger who wants an audience with the Barghest.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36373 = ~Then why're you walking <PRO_HIMHER> past the Barghest's tent? I just saw him there.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36374 = ~I'm not just takin' 'em to see the Barghest, idiot. I've got this. You just worry about getting your people ready to face the Hells.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36375 = ~Here we are. Now, get in.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36376 = ~I thought we were being taken to the Barghest.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36377 = ~I think what we have here is a failure to communicate. I wish to see the Barghest.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36378 = ~I'll not be caged, by you or any man.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36379 = ~Jal khaless zhah waela. There is no "failure to communicate" here.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36380 = ~You'll see the Barghest soon. After you get in the cage.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36381 = ~I'd prefer to see him before bars get involved, if at all possible.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36382 = ~This is how you treat a messenger bringing word from Caelar?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36383 = ~I'll see him after I put you in the ground.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36384 = ~Die, lackey of light!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36386 = ~You're making a grave error. I'll be taking this up with your commander, you can be sure of that.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36387 = ~Fair enough.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36388 = ~Not going to happen.~

@36389 = ~I'll risk it.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36390 = ~Very well.~

@36391 = ~You risk your life speaking to me like that.~

@36392 = ~I knew it. You're no messengers. Kill them! Now!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36394 = ~I don't think he cares what you'd prefer.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36395 = ~You don't get in the cage, there'll be more than bars involved—there'll be blades. Get in the cage.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36396 = ~All right.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36397 = ~Blades, you say? Bring them on.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36398 = ~There's a wise <PRO_MANWOMAN>. In you go.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

@36403 = ~I wish to cross the bridge.~

@36405 = ~You dare address me in such a manner? Let me speak to your commander!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36407 = ~Far be it from me to question the Shining Lady's orders. Farewell.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36408 = ~That seems a little extreme.~

@36501 = ~For 100 gold pieces, I will.~

@36502 = ~Done. Hand it over.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36503 = ~I need them. They're my best chance of getting Adoy out of my head—OH YES, I WILL GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD! IT'S COMING, BELIEVE YOU ME!~

@36517 = ~Yes, I've got one! What else?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36518 = ~Ugh. Even if I knew where to get one, I wouldn't be carrying it around. Anything more?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36519 = ~Haven't seen one. Wouldn't want to.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36520 = ~I saw one not too long ago, but I don't have it and I'm sure it's gone by now.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36527 = ~Sorry, I don't have anything on your list.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

@36532 = ~What's your mental health worth to you?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36535 = ~Very well.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36538 = ~Save it. Join me and we'll find what you need together.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36539 = ~Good enough. Here's what I've got.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36540 = ~Let me know when you've got more.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36544 = ~Come with me, Neera. We'll find what you need together.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36545 = ~Those are some pretty esoteric ingredients.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36547 = ~I'm sorry, Neera. I haven't.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36548 = ~Actually, yes. I've got your spider leg.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36549 = ~I did find a feather from a planetar's wing.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36550 = ~I believe you needed a potion of perception? I've got one.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36551 = ~Turnip juice. Take it. I don't want it.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36552 = ~Anything else—NO, I DON'T WANT TO GO LOOK AT BIRDS, ADOY. WHY WOULD YOU EVEN ASK THAT?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36554 = ~The spider leg.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36560 = ~That's all.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36561 = ~I'll take what I can get.~

@36564 = ~You'll be free of that annoying pest Adoy in no time. Here, take it.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36565 = ~How much will you give me for them?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36566 = ~How much is it worth to you?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36567 = ~I can give you one hundred and let me see... 107 gold pieces.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36568 = ~Keep it. Your service will be your payment.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36569 = ~For turnip juice? I may be a child of Bhaal, but I'm not THAT evil. 5 gold will do.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36570 = ~You'll need more than that.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36571 = ~Really? You mean it? You're the best, <CHARNAME>. Let's go find some potion stuff!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36572 = ~Aw, come ON... Fine. Just make sure you hang onto the stuff while I get the money.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36573 = ~You want me to come with you?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36574 = ~Well, keep on looking.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36575 = ~Come look with me.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36576 = ~I will, I promise.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36577 = ~I would, had I ever started.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36578 = ~Thanks, <CHARNAME>. I really appreciate this; you have no idea.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36579 = ~Whatever. If you find something on the list, just come tell me. All right? All right.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36581 = ~They are that. Did you sort out your problems with the voice in your head?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36583 = ~Yeah. But on the bright side, we'll probably be brutally murdered soon.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36584 = ~I've no time to talk with you now. And little desire to talk with you any other time.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36590 = ~I'm glad to hear it. Now I feel comfortable inquiring as to whether you'd consider joining me in the trials ahead.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36591 = ~Well, that's good news, at least. Good luck.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36592 = ~Good. I have need of your abilities.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36600 = ~Shhh. More laughs if we let the little lady live unenlightened.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36603 = ~What's the problem, Neera?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36604 = ~"Any more." Not "no more." You can't stand any more.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36605 = ~I've no patience for your whining right now, half-elf.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36606 = ~I've little patience for whining right now.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36609 = ~I'm sorry to have disappointed you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36610 = ~You make it sound so grim...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36611 = ~If you don't like it, leave. I'll not change the way I do things to satisfy your aspirations.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36619 = ~It's nothing personal, Neera. I'm just doing what's best for everyone.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36620 = ~I can't take you yelling at someone who isn't there anymore.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36621 = ~I didn't want you around to begin with.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36623 = ~Stay here. I'll return for you if I change my mind.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36635 = ~Not right now, Neera.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36639 = ~May the better get better and the worse, worse.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36640 = ~Perhaps I can make things a little more better than worse. Join me.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36641 = ~You can ask for little more.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36643 = ~You wound me, Neera.~

@36644 = ~It's kind of an honor...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36645 = ~You would be wise to treat it as such.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36648 = ~Thanks. For you too.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36653 = ~I do, actually.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36654 = ~I've got one, but what in Toril would you want with such a thing?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36655 = ~Sorry, no.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36657 = ~No, not really. Sorry.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36658 = ~No. What in the hells would I do with a feather from a planetar's wing? Tickle a deva?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36659 = ~Yes. A Red Wizard in the crusade camp had one. Why do you want it?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36662 = ~It can be yours for just 50 gold pieces.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@36663 = ~Here you go. Out of curiosity, why do you need it?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

(Conjuration)

Level: Quest
Sphere: Summoning
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

Ghostly figures called by the Shaman swirl around the battlefield, tormenting the Shaman's adversaries. All enemies within the area of effect take 3d8 points of magic damage per round for the next 3 rounds (no save). In addition, all living enemies (undead and constructs are unaffected) must save vs. Spell or lose 2 points of Strength every round for 5 rounds.

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37919 = ~I'm afraid I bring grave news of Jaheira.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37920 = ~Taking the first step on my path to annihilate Caelar and her "crusade."~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37921 = ~What—what are you saying? Speak p-plainly.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37922 = ~She's dead. I'm sorry.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37923 = ~I'd give anything not to have to tell you this. Khalid. She's gone. Dead.~

@37924 = ~The judgmental cow breathes no more.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37927 = ~A surprise, then, but not an unpleasant one, I hope. Certainly not once you hear what I've got to say.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37928 = ~Fair enough. It was about the last place I ever expected to be. Looking on the bright side, though, I didn't come alone.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37929 = ~It was an inevitable step on my path to wipe Caelar and her damnable crusade from the face of Faerûn.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37931 = ~As she is about you. But your trials are almost at an end.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37942 = ~You have a noble soul. Khalid. It's easy to see why Jaheira loves you. But you will be together, soon. I've brought Flaming Fist mercenaries with me from Baldur's Gate. Your crusade problem is near an end.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37943 = ~They need a victory, and they shall have it, when I and the Flaming Fist mercenaries to the south strike. Wait for the sign, then strike.~

@37944 = ~Thank the gods. I d-don't know how much longer we c-could have held out.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37946 = ~Get your people ready and wait for the sign.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37949 = ~What will the sign be?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37950 = ~The Fist will attack from the southwest. Watch for movement in that part of the crusade camp.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37951 = ~You'll know it when you see it, believe me.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37952 = ~Screaming, Khalid. The sign will be the screams of crusaders, dying by the score.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37955 = ~Forgive me, my friend. I didn't think. Your people will be free soon. Get them ready and await the sign to strike.~

@37958 = ~If-if-if there's n-no other way... V-very well.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37959 = ~I look forward to it.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37960 = ~Would you like to see what we've d-done here? Examine the d-defenses?~

@37961 = ~A look around can do no harm.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37962 = ~You've better things to do than show me around. I'll check the place out for myself.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37963 = ~I've seen enough. Gather your people and wait for the sign.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37964 = ~Follow m-me.~

@37965 = ~As you w-wish.~

@37967 = ~A camp of Flaming Fist mercenaries a few miles the south await my word. We will smash the crusaders 'twixt your people and mine.~

@37968 = ~Jaheira and fifty others stand ready to strike. All you need to do is be ready and wait for the sign.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37969 = ~Yes. Not that I couldn't handle the crusaders myself.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37970 = ~You would face Caelar? Jaheira w-won't be happy with that.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37971 = ~She may not approve, but she lets me make my own decisions.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37972 = ~She isn't. I'll make it up to her by reuniting you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37973 = ~Making Jaheira happy is a husband's job, not mine. I've fifty seasoned Flaming Fist mercenaries awaiting my word. We will smash the crusaders 'twixt your people and mine.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37974 = ~I'm afraid Jaheira's no long in a position to care one way or the other.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37975 = ~With a little help from your... friends.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37976 = ~Are you seeking Caelar alone?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37977 = ~No. More than two score Flaming Fist mercenaries are camped nearby.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37978 = ~No. I've Corwin here, a Flaming Fist company, and others waiting to strike a blow against the crusade.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37979 = ~I can handle the Caelar's minions.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37980 = ~N-now?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37982 = ~The longer we wait, the greater the risk of crusade reinforcements arriving.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37983 = ~Now.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37984 = ~We need no assistance. The crusaders shall fall before us like blades of grass beneath the scythe.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37985 = ~Very well. I'll summon everyone, and... we'll do this.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37986 = ~A quick confrontation could cool the crusaders' characteristic contrariness.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37987 = ~How soon can you mobilize your troops?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37988 = ~Calling them troops may be a little g-generous. But what they lack in discipline, they make up with det-determination.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37989 = ~Well, get them ready and wait for the sign.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37990 = ~I'm surprised they haven't done so already.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37991 = ~We need to hit them before they hit us. Gather your people. It's time to strike a blow against the crusade.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37992 = ~I think they're hoping you'll burn the fort down without their having to get involved.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37993 = ~They're hoping to starve you out. Secure a surrender without bloodshed.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37994 = ~If I could ensure the safety of the people here, I'd gladly surrender the fort.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37996 = ~Caelar's people already control Boareskyr Bridge. They'll find little of use in these walls. Certainly nothing worth dying over—for either side.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37997 = ~Perhaps I can arrange a peaceful surrender.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@37998 = ~Crusades are not renowned for sensibility. Force is the only language they'll understand.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38000 = ~Or perhaps we could kick their butts! Now THAT is a plan Minsc could get behind.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38001 = ~Sensibility? Overrated.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38002 = ~I just want these people's lives sp-spared. Do you think you can do that?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38003 = ~I can try.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38004 = ~Your people aren't leaving here without a fight. Fortunately, I've brought friends. Gather your forces and wait for the sign. This is where we break the crusade.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38005 = ~I could, but I won't. You've been on the defensive too long. Gather your forces. We're taking the battle to the crusade.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38006 = ~Can you leave the fort undetected?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38007 = ~I'll manage.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38008 = ~Ehh... I was hoping you could help me out with that.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38009 = ~If I wished. But if we're going to negotiate a surrender, there's no reason for subterfuge. Take me to the main gate.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38011 = ~With the wild mage in here, that's a d-distinct possibility.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38012 = ~I'm proud of you, Khalid. You've done well here.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38013 = ~She's right. But you'll soon do better.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38014 = ~Holding the fort in the face of the crusade is impressive. Would you mind if I took a look around?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38015 = ~She's too kind. Why haven't you taken the battle to the crusade?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38016 = ~W-we have been hard-pressed just to d-defend the fort.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38017 = ~It is the crusade that will be hard-pressed now that mighty Voghiln fights at your side.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38018 = ~You do not know what Khalid had to work with here, <CHARNAME>. I do. That he has held the fort is nigh miraculous.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38019 = ~I'd like to look around and see what he's been working with for myself.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38021 = ~That it has been held with him in command is miraculous indeed. But the time to hold the fort is past. The crusade is ill-prepared for an assault.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38022 = ~I'm sure w-word of your arrival's spread through the fort b-by now. If-if-if anyone interf-feres with you, just come see me.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38023 = ~Come with us, Khalid. It's been too long since I've been in your company.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38024 = ~A good idea. Join us.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38025 = ~I'm sure he's much to do, but if you'd rather stay with Khalid than come with me, I'll understand.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38026 = ~I've no interest in listening to this stammering buffoon.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38027 = ~Of course.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38028 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. We'll speak again soon, I'm sure.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38029 = ~That stammering buffoon is my husband, <CHARNAME>.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38030 = ~D-don't make a fuss, darling. Y-you have to go with <PRO_HIMHER>. We made a p-promise to Gorion.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38031 = ~...Very well. Let's go see the fort, then.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38032 = ~There are fifty fighters camped less than a mile to the east, ready to take the battle to the crusade.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38033 = ~Now is the time for Bridgefort to take its revenge upon Caelar's disciples.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38034 = ~Await the sign, Khalid. The crusaders' screams will mark the start of the battle for Bridgefort.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38035 = ~The question is, are you?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38036 = ~I'll get my p-people ready.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38037 = ~My people have been beaten down for I don't know h-how long. I don't know how much more they have to give.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38038 = ~Perhaps there's another way to end this. We could try to negotiate.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38039 = ~May we take a look around? See exactly what we have to work with when it comes to fighting the crusade?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38041 = ~Negotiate with those zealots? Ridiculous.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38042 = ~Yes, well. Not EVERYONE here attempted to slaughter their priest.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38043 = ~It pains to me to say it, but the half-orc's right. Has anyone else seen any indication that the crusade is willing to bargain? Because I haven't.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38045 = ~I can try.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38046 = ~If you're willing to leave your supplies here, there's a chance I can talk them into letting your people go.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38047 = ~Of course I could. But if the choice is between talking to the enemy or killing them, I know what I would choose.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38048 = ~Another pointless battle. Joy.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38049 = ~I don't know that I like our ch-chances, <CHARNAME>. But say the word and I'll have the drawbridge lowered. If we must die, let it be in battle!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38050 = ~In battle at my side, you mean.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38051 = ~Of course, d-dear. I'd have it n-no other way.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38052 = ~Come with us, Khalid. We'll face the enemy together.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38053 = ~Jaheira, you'll stay with me. Khalid, you go rally your people. The battle for Bridgefort begins now!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38054 = ~I would. You have proven yourself useful to me, Jaheira. Your husband has not. Until he does, he's naught to me but excess weight.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38055 = ~As you wish.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38056 = ~Victory or d-d-death!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38057 = ~Have a care, <CHARNAME>. You're talking about the man I love.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38058 = ~D-don't make a fuss, darling. Y-you have to go with <PRO_HIMHER>. We made a p-promise to Gorion.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38059 = ~...You are right, Khalid. But when this is over, we WILL be together again.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38060 = ~Then let us end it quickly.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38061 = ~And my people are ill-prepared f-for a fight.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38062 = ~Do it, then. Please. Even with your help, I fear we could n-not repel the crusade if they attack ag-again.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38064 = ~Gather your people together and prepare. If negotiations fail, battle will be our only option.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38065 = ~The crusade should be worried about repelling us, not the other way around.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38066 = ~As you w-wish.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38067 = ~I'll get them ready.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38069 = ~Glad to hear it. What now?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38070 = ~Not a moment too soon. Arguably several minutes too late, but that's water under the bridge.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38071 = ~Save the compliments, Nederlok. Tell me what I want to hear: Tell me we're taking the battle to Caelar's door.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38075 = ~N-now we end this.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38076 = ~Our soldiers return, Hephernaan. What news do you bring me?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38078 = ~Unfortunate, but not unexpected. And the hero?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38080 = ~How is this possible, Hephernaan? How is it <PRO_HESHE> slips through our fingers, again and again?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38083 = ~Yes, my lady. I do.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38084 = ~<CHARNAME>. You're just in time. You did place the barrels we collected from Boareskyr where you were supposed to, correct?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38085 = ~Assuming no one stumbled upon them between my placing them and now, they should be ready.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38087 = ~I don't recall you being at Boareskyr to collect anything.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38088 = ~Are you questioning my honesty, de Lancie? Or just my competence?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38089 = ~I did not.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38090 = ~We're all on the same side, <CHARNAME>. At least I thought we were. Did you place the barrels or not?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38091 = ~I did.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38092 = ~No, I didn't.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38093 = ~What? Damn it!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38094 = ~Then watch as the walls fall down!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38095 = ~Regis Pyrrea!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38096 = ~Given the... free-spirited qualities of those involved in making the pendant, that's a questionable proposition. But we might as well give it a try. Hensleigh, would you be so kind?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38097 = ~Well, if someone did stumble upon them, they're about to get a nasty surprise. Hensleigh, you may proceed.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38098 = ~Damn it, <CHARNAME>, this isn't the time!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38099 = ~Hm. I must admit, I had some doubts whether that would work. Well done, <CHARNAME>.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38102 = ~<CHARNAME>? What are you doing here?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38103 = ~I'm here to fight the crusade.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38104 = ~Where do you think I'd be, de Lancie? Curled up in front of a nice fire?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38105 = ~I figured standing next to you was the safest place to be during a massive battle.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38106 = ~You'd have me be somewhere else?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38107 = ~No, I mean what are you doing on this spot? You should be taking the battle to Caelar.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38108 = ~How do you propose I do that?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38109 = ~As should you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38110 = ~We all have roles to play. Someone needs to guide our forces—not that I answer to you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38111 = ~Yes!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38112 = ~There's little you can do here.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38113 = ~Yes, very droll.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38118 = ~Watch yourself, lads—those archers aren't playing around.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38119 = ~Huh? Who're you?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@38120 = ~I'm <CHARNAME>. I'm here to help.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

@40367 = ~Please. Do what you can.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40373 = ~My wounds burn...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40377 = ~I... I feel stronger already. My dizziness fades. Yes, I believe I can stand now. Thank you, friend. You have done more than I dared hope possible.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40380 = ~You return.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40385 = ~No, I haven't.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40399 = ~Good. Good food...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40403 = ~Yaagh! Crusaders!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40407 = ~Bjarn Littleclub is my name. They kept me locked in cages above, but I managed to get free. Came down here and hid. So hungry. So, so hungry.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40441 = ~Sahuagin, that's the problem. A bunch of 'em came out the river, and now they're holed up in yonder cavern.~

@40484 = ~What're you doing? Aren't you going to drive the sahuagin out of the cavern?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40492 = ~Well, thanks for everything, then. You've been a great help.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40524 = ~What? Why not?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40569 = ~You are. But I don't like it much.~

@40577 = ~Path? What path?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40590 = ~Why would she do that?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

@40648 = ~Which one? WHICH ONE?!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40659 = ~It was.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40660 = ~It was a good story.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40665 = ~Oh, you're still here? Tell us another story. Come on, tell us.~

@40763 = ~Didn't I tell you to get lost?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

@40820 = ~Good point...~

@40849 = ~Good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Is there anything I can do for you?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40917 = ~Aack... pth... thank you. I apologize for our disarray. We've been trapped in those wretched vines for days.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40918 = ~No thanks needed. Lucky for you I happened by.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40919 = ~You've, uh, got a bit of leaf on your face still. The corner of your mouth. Other corner. There you go.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40920 = ~Glad to be of assistance. Now if you'll excuse me, I must be on my way.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40921 = ~How did you get stuck in there?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40922 = ~This conversation is barely begun and already it tires me. I'm moving on.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40923 = ~Wait just a moment. I have something very important to ask you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40929 = ~I'm sorry to hear that.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40930 = ~Cast out... in vines?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40932 = ~I met a druid named Ferrusk below. He made the mistake of attacking me, and I was forced to slay him.~

@40933 = ~Did you say Ferrusk? I think I met him. And killed him.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40935 = ~How can I help you further?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40937 = ~I kill the guy and you want MORE? All right, let's hear it.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40941 = ~Of course. What do you want me to do?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40942 = ~Let's slow down a bit. I like to get to know people before I jump into their druid wars. What exactly do you want me to do?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40943 = ~What sort of reward can I expect?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40944 = ~I'll think about it.~

@40946 = ~And what exactly do you want me to do?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40948 = ~I'll consider your offer. For now, I must go.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40950 = ~Very well. What do you want me to do?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40951 = ~I'll think about it.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40952 = ~That's not good enough. In fact, you should offer me a reward right now for cutting you loose. Otherwise I might put you back in the trap where I found you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40955 = ~Dog! I see I made a mistake in asking for your help. Begone from here.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40957 = ~We can show you the entrance to the caverns and help you get past its guardians. Then you must find the dark circle and plant the seed. Will you help us?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40958 = ~It would be an honor.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40959 = ~Purifying evil trees doesn't really interest me, but I'd like the help getting into the caverns. Count me in.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40960 = ~Give me the seed. I might decide to help you if it serves my interests in the caverns.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40961 = ~What guardians?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40962 = ~An honor they have in no way earned.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40966 = ~I have to think about it.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40967 = ~Here is the enchanted seed. Once it touches the tree's roots, it will sprout and its magic will awaken.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40969 = ~Go, then.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40972 = ~Gods! It smells worse here than the outhouse did after Winthrop was done with it.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40973 = ~What is this foul miasma? Are you responsible?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40977 = ~This is a waste of time, and the air is growing even fouler. Time to depart.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40978 = ~Do you have any idea what this creature was trying to say, Jaheira?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40980 = ~Wait... I think I can actually understand this creature.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40981 = ~I feel strange. My head is spinning.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40982 = ~Maybe you should sit down for a minute.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40985 = ~No, I... I feel something. Someone. Inside my mind. They're trying to tell me something...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40986 = ~What are they saying? Concentrate, Jaheira.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40987 = ~Ignore the voices; focus on me. Fight for focus.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40988 = ~Get outside now!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40990 = ~Well done, Jaheira.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40991 = ~Thanks for talking to the spore ghosts, I guess.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40992 = ~Next time warn me of the danger of these creatures.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40993 = ~They're so loud I can't... I can't separate them. Augh!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40994 = ~Jaheira!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40996 = ~What kind of voices? What are they saying?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40997 = ~Are you sure it's the cloud? Did you eat anything unfamiliar recently? Push the voices away and concentrate on the present.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@40998 = ~Get out of the cloud right now.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41000 = ~We'll check it out. Thanks, M'Khiin.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41001 = ~Hopefully, this isn't some clever fungal ruse. Let's take a look.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41002 = ~If this is a trap, I hold you responsible.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41006 = ~I don't understand... or do I? Your words are starting to make sense.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41007 = ~Wait, I'm beginning to understand you. Or I'm going crazy, one or the other.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41008 = ~What is it you are saying, creature?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41014 = ~My head is spinning. Must... focus...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41015 = ~These spores are making me dizzy. And hungry. No, no time for eating. Focus.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41016 = ~What are you doing to me? This is some kind of trap. Must keep my head clear!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41018 = ~My head... aaargh!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41019 = ~I understand now. By a corpse to the north... you want me to have what's there.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41025 = ~Arg margle puff to you too.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41026 = ~Are you threatening me? I warn you, I can defend myself.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41028 = ~I wish I could speak your language, but I can't. I'm sorry.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41029 = ~I hope "margle" is a flattering term in spore-speak.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41030 = ~You begin to irritate me, monster.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41034 = ~As angry as you might be, I'll be angrier if you don't back off.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41036 = ~Is this a graveyard? I'm sorry. Do you understand my apology?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41037 = ~You dump your dead in old ruins? That's a terrible burial custom. Sorry for tromping on your ancestors.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41038 = ~I go where I please. Now get out of my way.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41040 = ~Perhaps we can be of assistance here?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41041 = ~Bellowgulp! It's good to see you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41042 = ~Perfect timing, if your intention was to be eaten by strange fungus-creatures.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41043 = ~If you believe you can help, then help.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41046 = ~That's a lucky coincidence. My spore is pretty rusty.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41048 = ~Margl flrg floog.~

@41054 = ~Floogar mb marg.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41055 = ~It seems they have a connection to the Concocter. He... he's agreeing to leave with them!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41057 = ~I thought you two were a team.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41059 = ~We ARE a team...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41060 = ~I didn't expect this at all. But the myconids won't do you any harm. I have to decide what to do now.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41062 = ~Good luck following the fungus trail if that's what you decide.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41065 = ~Let the Concocter ask.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41069 = ~It's awfully sticky. Ew. Thank them, I suppose.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41072 = ~Well, that's good to know. I'll just let you be on your way then.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41075 = ~"The Myconids and the Alchemist." A fine title for a tale of adventure.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41077 = ~Decisions, decisions. Can I help you with something?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41085 = ~That one cuts an impressive figure, for an ogre. He could best both the other two together.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41087 = ~That is a FEMALE ogre? ...Interesting.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41091 = ~Slug is NOT dead. We should be planning a rescue!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41092 = ~No, we should be picking off those smugglers heading for the keep. Then we can take their goods!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41093 = ~You're an idiot, Cheski. We should be looking for a new camp far away from this crusade.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41094 = ~I challenge you! Winner is the new chief!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41095 = ~I challenge too! A champion can fight for me.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41096 = ~With Slug gone, you HAVE no champion.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41097 = ~For once you speak with brains, Cheski. We will see them in a minute when I break your skull open!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41102 = ~Put your weapons away unless you want to be slaughtered. I'm not here to kidnap you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41107 = ~I ask myself that same question every day. While I ponder the answer, why not tell me your problem?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41109 = ~No reason. I'll be on my way.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41111 = ~All right, I'm leaving.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41112 = ~You're the only ones who will die today!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41113 = ~It might not concern me directly, but if you're enemies of the crusade, we're on the same side.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41114 = ~It can't hurt to tell me your story. At least it won't hurt as much as you two killing each other.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41115 = ~You're really taking control of the situation, Arbinge. I can see you'll make a fine chief.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41116 = ~He will NOT be the chief. I will.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41117 = ~I don't know; Arbinge seems like a cunning leader to me.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41118 = ~Oh, I see. I was mistaken; you are obviously the superior candidate.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41119 = ~Actually, neither of you will be, because you'll all be dead.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41120 = ~That's right. The stranger knows a good ogre chief when <HESHE> sees one.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41121 = ~The stranger is a fool! We have to fight to see who's best.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41122 = ~That's right. The stranger knows a good ogre chief when <HESHE> sees one.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41123 = ~The stranger is a fool! We have to fight to see who's best.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41124 = ~These two buffoons are somehow correct. Combat is the only way to decide who will take over now that Slug is gone.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41127 = ~What is this place, anyway?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41129 = ~What happened to your mate?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41130 = ~So whoever wins a fight gets to rule the camp?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41131 = ~What is this place anyway?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41134 = ~What happened to your mate?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41135 = ~Whoever wins this fight gets to rule the camp, is that right?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41136 = ~What is this place anyway?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41139 = ~The crusaders took over the tunnels?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41140 = ~I see. I had another question.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41144 = ~I can't think about what they might be doing to Slug. Our camp needs a strong leader!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41145 = ~You said the crusaders took over the tunnels?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41148 = ~I see. I had another question.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41150 = ~You're ogre... merchants?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41151 = ~Oh yes, I can see from the vast amount of nothing spread around that you're doing a great trade.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41152 = ~Don't try to mislead me, ogre.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41153 = ~I have some knowledge of the subtle arts. From the look of your setup here, I'd say you're more in the mercenary trade.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41154 = ~We had more stock at our permanant camp, of course.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41155 = ~You're really ogre merchants?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@41156 = ~Perfectly understandable. Except for the part where I don't believe a word of it.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

@44345 = ~Growing weary, you set down for the night. As you drift into sleep, a sudden chill falls over you. Your eyes open, and you are not where you were.

You stand upon a lake of ice. The lake stretches into a haze in every direction, with no shoreline visible. Below, you can make out the form of a terrifying abomination roving along the lake bed, consumed with hatred and malice. It cannot break through the ice to reach you. You are immune to the beast's impotent rage, shielded from its fury.

On the horizon, the sun begins to rise. As it rises, it grows brighter... then brighter still. You try to shield your eyes from its radiance to no avail. Its brilliant light burns your eyes, and you are struck blind.

Then the sky begins to darken. Gentle winds grow stronger. Caught in a sudden storm, you cling to the raft as it's tossed wildly about. The waters around you turn black, then red. A familiar scent fills your nostrils. You are floating on a sea of blood.

A bolt of lightning slices down from the darkened sky. It strikes your raft, blasting it to splinters. As you sink beneath waves of blood, you see the dark shapes of buildings, trees, and statues. This land was once above the waves. As you touch the foul sea's bottom, a familiar voice growls in your ear: "Did you think I had left you?"

You awake.~

Imoen sits before you. You can see her, but she cannot see you. She waits back in her quarters at the Ducal Palace, sitting upon her bed, facing away from the locked door.

Someone knocks at her door, but she continues to look forward. The knocking does not stop; it continues, the impacts on the wood growing in volume and force. Soon the entire door shakes from the furious assault on the other side. Imoen continues to stare through you.

Whatever is on the other side of the door has a sinister intent. You hear growls, whines, and scratching in addition to pounding. You try to warn Imoen, but no sound comes from your mouth. You try to reach out to her, but you cannot move.

Suddenly, the scrabbling stops. A key can be heard unlocking the door. The handle turns, and the door swings open. The inhuman figure beyond the threshold is shrouded in darkness. Imoen does not look at it, but you now see the terror in her eyes. "He will not be ignored," she says. You awaken.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@45419 = ~I know that Candlekeep has an ancient book from the Netherese Empire, yes. I believe there's hidden writing in the book and my potion can reveal it!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@45447 = ~Get to the point.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@45448 = ~I'll explain to them that I can enhance an existing tome by revealing its hidden contents. That's almost like giving them a book, yes?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@45449 = ~I'm not sure it will work, but you can try.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47274 = ~Fine. I'll tell him.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47276 = ~Thank you again. May the Morninglord light your way.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47297 = ~Pull yourself together. You're a fighter, not a milkmaid.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47298 = ~You're right. I... I'll not dishonor my sister's memory. My heart is broken, but my will is strong. The crusade will pay for what they've done this <DAYNIGHTALL>.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47517 = ~Ah, it's you. Have you reached any conclusion regarding my quarreling rangers?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47550 = ~I—I believe in Caelar. She is the light. My family lost many in the Dragonspear Wars...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47559 = ~I doubt Leopas will see it that way. Valis certainly doesn't.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47574 = ~What? I—I have little to offer, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. My armor, my sword, my bow and a quiver of arrows. A handful of gold, nothing more.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47578 = ~Ah, well... I also have a couple potions of invisibility.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

@47672 = ~Corinth, turn on the crusade? He hasn't got the stones. He hasn't even got one stone. Useless.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47676 = ~Sure. Whatever.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47686 = ~He didn't do it, you know. I don't believe he did it. Corinth wouldn't be so foolish as to betray us.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47706 = ~Well, yeah, he had family in Innisfall. And Innisfall managed to, you know, run like the hells just a few minutes before the crusade arrived. That doesn't prove anything. Nothing, that's what it proves. What I'm saying, if you listen to me, what I'm saying is, Corinth isn't gonna turn on the crusade. He just isn't. FACT.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47712 = ~Hm? What? Oh! It's you. He didn't do it.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47717 = ~So you're gonna tell Leopas Corinth is innocent?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47724 = ~Ho, there. I am Damarr.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47744 = ~I know them both well enough, I think.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47764 = ~I try. Take care of yourself. Caelar's enemies are all around us. We are safe in her light, but... well, we could always be a little safer, you know?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47765 = ~Back for more?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47821 = ~Yeah? What do you want?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47833 = ~Weren't nothing. If it were something, I'd have charged you for it. Be off with you now.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47834 = ~There something I can help you with?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47849 = ~Let's hear it then. Did Corinth betray the crusade? Or is Valis bearing false witness against her fellow ranger?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47865 = ~How is this possible? Explain yourself.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47881 = ~Might I have a word?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47890 = ~I thought I could manage this. Fight for Caelar, for the greater good. That was what I wanted to do. Her cause is righteous. I believe in her, but... Some of the things I've seen in her service... Some of the things I've done...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47904 = ~What a bunch of pathetic babies! I've never seen a worse lot in my entire career!~ [BD48454]

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47922 = ~I understand you'll be training me.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47928 = ~Sorry, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I got a little carried away.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47931 = ~Your fighting style reminds me of my own. You enjoy killing, don't you?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47941 = ~Much better. Keep practicing, soldier.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47942 = ~Uh, okay. I guess I could try that.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

@47961 = ~You mean I should try to fight... well, dirtier? What if I kicked low, like this... and feinted off to one side...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47964 = ~Much better. Keep practicing and you'll do fine.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@47965 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>!~

@48174 = ~What should we do?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

@48225 = ~What could be causing her poor condition?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

@48227 = ~Thank you, Viconia.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@48229 = ~Why is she worse off than the others?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

I found a halfling named Takos sitting in the ruins of his inn. Rowdy crusaders, mercenaries, I assume, burned the inn to smoldering timbers and they—or someone else—stole three of Takos's family heirlooms. I should keep watch for a shield, a mirror, and a cloak.~

@57496 = ~Again, our thanks. Farewell.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57498 = ~Ho, there! Oh, thank the gods, I thought I'd never catch up to you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57499 = ~Ophyllis? What are you doing here?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57500 = ~And you were wrong. What a shocking turn of events that is.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57501 = ~You never struck me as being suicidal. I assume you're here with my money.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57502 = ~Making good on my debt to you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57503 = ~I appreciate the effort, my friend, but you shouldn't have made it. I've gotten by without the gold you lost.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57504 = ~You have my gold?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57505 = ~You may have just saved your life, Ophyllis. Give me the gold.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57506 = ~But I did lose it, and that haunts me, <CHARNAME>. It haunts me. I will see you repaid, I swear it. And today is the first step on the path that will see what is rightfully yours returned.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57508 = ~Well, I put the word out I was looking for gold and a fairly large quantity of it, but actual coins are hard to come by. An artisan named Foxleigh did have this, though.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57511 = ~Calm yourself, Ophyllis. I'm happy to get any of the gold you lost returned, no matter how insignificant the amount. I appreciate the effort you've made, coming all this way. Sincerely.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57512 = ~Every little bit counts. How did you come into possession of this gold? Nothing too nefarious, I hope, though not enough to care if nefariousness was indeed involved.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57513 = ~I'll take every gold piece I can get my hands on. Give it to me now.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57514 = ~Yes, well, it is rather a large piece of gold. I tried to find someone who'd offer me a fair exchange in common currency, but no luck. I could have had it melted down, but that would have taken I don't know how long.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57515 = ~Had it melted down? Had what melted down? I don't understand.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57516 = ~So what you have to give me isn't common currency? What is it, then?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57517 = ~Get to the point, Ophyllis, or I'll find a sword to get to it for you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57518 = ~Well, as I say, I put the word out I was looking for gold and a fairly large quantity of it, and actual coins are hard to come by, for obvious reasons, but an artisan by the name of Foxleigh was willing to offer me this.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57519 = ~And what is this precisely?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57520 = ~This is a bust of me.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57521 = ~I know little of the arts, but I know what I like. As a rule, I do like my face. But my face doesn't usually have the seam of a mold running down the middle of its nose, as this bust does.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57524 = ~I appreciate the effort you've made, Ophyllis. Consider your debt to me repaid.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57525 = ~What in the Nine Hells am I supposed to do with a gold bust of myself?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57528 = ~I love it, Ophyllis. This is worth more to me than any mere gold coins ever could be. Consider your debt paid, my friend.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57529 = ~This should cover the interest on your debt. Now get out of my sight and don't return to it until you've got my fortune, in a form more useful than this wretched hunk of metal!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57530 = ~GO NOW, OPHYLLIS.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57532 = ~Oh no, no, no. Can't do that. I failed you, and I failed Grand Duke Belt. I'll not rest until I've corrected my mistake, you have my word on that. I'll go now.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57534 = ~Agh! No, please, I'm trying to repay you, I swear! Please, just give me a chance. PLEASE!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57536 = ~Ahhh... Oh, ow. Ow, ow, ow, that—that really hurts...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57537 = ~Well, you've—ahn!—you've really gone and done it this time, Ophyllis...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57540 = ~Don't move, Ophyllis. You need healing.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57541 = ~You're probably right about that. You've got a sword in your chest.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57542 = ~Why are you here, Ophyllis? Do you have my gold?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57546 = ~That doesn't matter right now. We need to find someone to heal you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57547 = ~Hang on, Ophyllis. I have a potion that will help you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57548 = ~Don't worry about that. Be still; let me heal you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57549 = ~There are more important things in this world than possessions, Ophyllis. Now be still. We can heal you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57550 = ~You mean the sword in your chest? Uh, I think it'd better stay where it is until we can get you some healing.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57551 = ~I'd have preferred my gold, but I'll take what I can get.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57553 = ~AAAAGH!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57557 = ~How 'bout the fancy lady with the orbs goin' 'round her head?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57558 = ~Nah. She's got a knife in 'er boot.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57559 = ~Let's roll that lout with the glowin' staff!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57560 = ~Yeah, I like the look of him!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57561 = ~Roll a wizard? You WANT to get fried? Pass.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57562 = ~Them two in the armor with the fancy stitching don't look so tough.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57563 = ~Let's see if they come 'round again.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57564 = ~Oh, how 'bout them with the sparkly cloaks? Look like bards or somesuch.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57565 = ~You dolt, those are just cheap costumes.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57566 = ~Yeah, we wanna roll someone with lots o' gold!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57568 = ~Whatcha want, ugly?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57569 = ~You'll keep movin' if you know what's good for ya.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57570 = ~Looking to lighten your purse, chum?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57571 = ~Well, well, whadda we got here?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57572 = ~Some call me the hero of Baldur's Gate.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57573 = ~Just a concerned citizen.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57574 = ~Someone who's about to rain pain like you've never known before down on you and your sorry crew.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57575 = ~Is that right? Well, maybe you should just shove off 'fore ya get hurt.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57577 = ~Sound advice. I'll be on my way, then.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57578 = ~I'm not the one who's going to be hurt here.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57579 = ~And...? You offering yourself as a pick? Now that I think of it, you got the look of someone with a bit o' coin in your pocket.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57580 = ~It's a bit late for that, friend. You have the look of someone with a bit o' coin in your pocket.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57581 = ~Oh, aye? We'll see about that. You look like someone with a bit o' coin to your name.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57582 = ~Hehe, that's right. You tell 'em, Lluis!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57583 = ~How 'bout you hand over every copper you have and maybe we'll let you go?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57584 = ~Are you so blind you can't see a skilled warrior when <PRO_HESHE> stands before you? Think twice before challenging me. You wouldn't be the first band of thugs I've taken down.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57585 = ~My kind isn't known for its patience—or its weakness. Begone, unless you'd have me tear you all to bloody shreds.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57586 = ~You're thugs and bullies. You'll not get a single coin from me.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57587 = ~I don't want any trouble. Here, take all my money.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57588 = ~How about YOU give ME all your gold and maybe I'll let you go?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57590 = ~Get ahold of yourself, Asery, you coward.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57591 = ~I j-just remembered I left my front door unlocked. Bye.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57593 = ~We were hoping you'd say that.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57594 = ~Get <PRO_HIMHER>!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57595 = ~We'll take it from your body, along with everything else you've got—get <PRO_HIMHER>!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57596 = ~I don't think you quite understand the way this works, friend.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57597 = ~Welcome to the Three Old Kegs! Step through this door and experience one of the finest inns Baldur's Gate has to offer!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57598 = ~You must be drumming up quite a bit of business.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57599 = ~Do you have to stand outside and shout all day?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57600 = ~Thank you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57603 = ~What is it?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57604 = ~You can ask, but I make no promises.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57605 = ~Don't.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57606 = ~I've been shouting out here for hours—my voice is starting to go. If you're going inside, would you ask Katheera to send a drink out for me?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57607 = ~Consider it done.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57608 = ~What's in it for me?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57609 = ~I'm not interested.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57610 = ~My thanks? You don't really expect payment for a few seconds' work?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57611 = ~Of course not. I'll talk to this Katheera presently.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57612 = ~I make it a habit to hope for the best but expect the worst. I'll speak to this serving wench for you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57613 = ~You expect someone to help you free of charge?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57615 = ~I see. I'll not trouble you further, then.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57616 = ~Enjoy your stay in Baldur's Gate!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57617 = ~Robel, the crier working outside, is losing his voice. He could use a drink.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57619 = ~Surely a lady of your competence and composure can find a way to send the drink out sooner than later? The other servers must look up to such a woman as yourself. Think how it'll look to let another employee of the Three Old Kegs go thirsty.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57621 = ~Robel's working so hard to bring customers in. I'm sure you and the other servers have benefited from the extra hours and the tips. The least you could do is get him a hot drink.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57622 = ~I'll let him know a drink is coming eventually, then.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57623 = ~Well, I tried. Robel will have to make do as best he can.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57624 = ~All right, all right, you've convinced me. I'll have the kitchen mix some hot lemon water with a bit of rum and honey and send it out right away.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57626 = ~Thank you. I'm sure Robel will appreciate it.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57627 = ~Fancy that! The servers often have sore throats by shift's end. I'll pass that on to the others. Much obliged!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57629 = ~I know something about healing herbs. If you add a bit of slippery elm bark or sage, the drink will be all the more soothing.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57630 = ~I'm sure he'll appreciate that.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57631 = ~Well, back to work. Enjoy your stay at the Three Old Kegs.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57632 = ~Bloody hells, I'm parched! Any word on that drink?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57633 = ~Katheera will send one out right away.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57634 = ~Katheera's going to send one out as soon as she can, but it may be a while. They're very busy inside.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57635 = ~Not yet.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57636 = ~Let me know when you've talked to Katheera.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57637 = ~Thanks for the help—I appreciate it. Here, take a few coins for your troubles.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57639 = ~Now I must return to work. Enjoy your <DAYNIGHTALL>!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57640 = ~Come on in, folks, come in and slake your thirst at the Three Old Kegs!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57641 = ~We've Luskan ale, Calimshite brandy, and an orcish brew that'll knock your teeth out!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57642 = ~The crowds keep pouring in! Thanks again for getting me that drink.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57643 = ~Ah, gods, why? Why? What am I going to do?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57644 = ~I've raised the money you need. 15 gold. Go, bury your cousin.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57645 = ~What's going on here? Is that man dead?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57647 = ~This looks like trouble, and I've enough of that in my life. May your fortune turn in future. Farewell.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57648 = ~He is my cousin, a refugee. He came to the city to stay with me, but caught a fever on the road. H-he was so sick when he arrived... He lived only a few hours before he die—before he passed.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57649 = ~I am truly sorry for your loss.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57650 = ~A sad tale to be sure. Er, could you tell me why he's lying in that cart?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57651 = ~Your tale is tragic, but hardly unique. These are hard times. I'll leave you to mourn your loss.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57653 = ~15 gold is all you need? Here, take it—may it ease your grief in this trying period.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57654 = ~That's not so much money. I'll see if I can raise 15 gold and return to you in due course.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57655 = ~100 gold for a burial? I'm a cleric myself, and I can tell you that's far too expensive. Which temple did you visit? I'll be having a word with its priest...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57656 = ~I've heard that you can get a corpse taken care of discreetly at the Three Old Kegs for 100 gold. Quite a coincidence, isn't it?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57657 = ~It seems strange that a temple would charge so much. Which temple did you visit? I'd like to have a word with its administrators.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57658 = ~Your story rings false, woman. You seem more agitated than grief-stricken. What's really going on here?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57659 = ~Nothing I care to do. Farewell.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57660 = ~Oh, thank you! You are truly sent by the gods. I'm going back to the temple right away!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57661 = ~That takes a great weight from my mind. Thank you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57662 = ~Begone, then.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57663 = ~All right, this clearly isn't going to work. I might as well tell you the truth. The man in the cart is my late husband. He was a drunken brute. Life with him was a nightmare.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57666 = ~That sounds a bit more credible. I'm still not sure I believe you, though.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57669 = ~You deserve to be rid of this violent man. Here, take this: 15 gold. Dispose of his body and speak to no one else of this matter.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57670 = ~No one should be treated as you were. I'll not say anything to the Fist.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57671 = ~I won't say anything to the Fist—for a price.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57672 = ~I make no promises. I'm leaving now.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57673 = ~Oh, thank you, thank you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. You've made a wretched life brighter this <DAYNIGHTALL>. I'll never forget this kindness. Farewell.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57674 = ~W-what? But I can't—I can't! Oh... very well. Here, take it. 85 gold, it's all I have. Would that I'd never crossed your path. Now I'll have to start over. Begone; I want nothing more to do with you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57675 = ~Don't turn me in, I beg you! I am at your mercy. I know you'll do the right thing.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57676 = ~Unless you have business with the Fist, I'll have to ask you to move on.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57677 = ~I want to talk to you about a man named Garachen. He owns a home by the Ducal Palace.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57679 = ~I'll just be moving along, then. A good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you, officer.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57683 = ~I need tell you nothing. This is Baldur's Gate—just look around. You'll see evidence of the crime all about you. Impossible to miss.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57684 = ~You may think murder is a joke, but I'm not laughing. Be on your way.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57685 = ~What? Unbelievable. Actually, on reflection it isn't, really, and that's a sad state of affairs. I'll send officers there to arrest her immediately. Thank you, citizen. Take this small reward for supporting the city in this time of crisis.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@57686 = ~Come with us, ma'am.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

I've attached to this letter a more detailed description of <CHARNAME>, the so-called hero of Baldur's Gate. The descriptions supplied by the Revered have been pitiful at best. I have turned my considerable talent to creating a decent representation of <PRO_HISHER> face.

Wait outside Dragonspear until <PRO_HESHE> passes by, then make your move. Be careful; <PRO_HESHE> is more powerful than you might expect. Subdue and capture <PRO_HIMHER> and return to the castle.

@60967 = ~Duke Eltan seems to think I should. He also suggested I contact a bard of some sort, didn't he?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60968 = ~I'm considering it. Tell me about this pair of Rashemi adventurers.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60969 = ~I can't fault you for that, given what's happened. But wherever we're going to go, let's go.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60970 = ~You can count on that. Let's go.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60971 = ~Well, do me a favor and make up your mind sooner than later. The crusade's wasting no time. We can't afford to, either.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60973 = ~All right, I've made my decision. Stay by me.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60974 = ~And the thieves?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60975 = ~Who are these adventurers from Rashemen you mentioned?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60978 = ~Coran and Safana. Not sure they're the sort of people we need in this venture, but Duke Eltan believed you might want them to join us.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60979 = ~Well, we'll not learn anything useful standing here talking. Stick close to me.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60980 = ~Perhaps. What about these adventurers from Rashemen?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60981 = ~I understand he thought the same of a cleric in the Flaming Fist headquarters. Don't tell me you forgot about him.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60982 = ~What do you think about the bard he suggested I contact?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60983 = ~A good thief can be a handy thing to have. What do you think of the monk, the one at the Iron Throne building?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60984 = ~Thievery—a despicable practice. Let us speak no more of it. Tell me about the monk.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60985 = ~A wychlaran named Dynaheir and her bodyguard, Minsc. She might be useful, but I have my doubts about him. Word is he's taken a few too many blows to the head and it's made him... let's call it unpredictable.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60986 = ~All right, let's be about our business. You'll watch my back?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60987 = ~You mentioned a bard, I believe?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60988 = ~Did you forget about the cleric at the Flaming Fist headquarters?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60989 = ~I assume this monk at the Iron Throne building is less erratic?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60992 = ~That's the tavern which only allows the ghost to sing, yes? Well, that's Garrick's concern, not mine. Let's be about our business. Stay close to me and watch my back.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60993 = ~That is odd. But we've other matters to attend to. Follow me.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60994 = ~The Iron Throne wasn't always welcoming to friendly monks, yet there's one there now, is there not?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60995 = ~Tell me about the Rashemi adventurers staying at the Three Old Kegs.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60996 = ~You mentioned some thieves...?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60997 = ~Are you trying to avoid the cleric at the Flaming Fist headquarters, or did you just forget about him?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@60999 = ~Captain Schael Corwin, allow me to introduce Dynaheir and Minsc of Rashemen.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61000 = ~This is Minsc of Rashemen.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61001 = ~Captain Schael Corwin of the Flaming Fist, allow me to introduce Dynaheir, wychlaran of Rashemen. Take a few minutes, get acquainted.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61002 = ~You know exactly what we have here—you brought me here to get them.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61003 = ~You can meet them on your own time. I've more important things to do.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61005 = ~It's a long way to Dragonspear, <CHARNAME>. Are you sure you want to bring the hamster along?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61006 = ~I am sure Minsc will prove invaluable, as will Boo.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61007 = ~The hamster and the ranger are a package deal, I'm afraid.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61008 = ~You question me, Captain Corwin? Don't.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61010 = ~I am.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61011 = ~Not just yet.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61012 = ~If I were, we wouldn't be standing here talking.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61013 = ~Surely we should depart immediately? Who knows what mischief Caelar might get up to while we dither?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61014 = ~The wychlaran has her priorities straight—I like that. <CHARNAME>, are you sure you don't want to go yet?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61015 = ~Very well. Let us leave this place.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61016 = ~Don't push me, Captain. When I'm depart, I will let you know.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61017 = ~Let's go.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61019 = ~Well met, <CHARNAME>. And even more well met, my lady...?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61020 = ~This is Safana. Safana, this is Captain Schael Corwin of the Flaming Fist.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61021 = ~Captain Schael Corwin of the Flaming Fist, meet Safana of no particular allegiance.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61022 = ~Captain Schael Corwin, Safana. I believe our business here is concluded, Corwin.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61023 = ~Good to meet you, Safana. I look forward to working together.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61025 = ~Are you ready to move on, <CHARNAME>?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61026 = ~I am.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61027 = ~No, not yet. I would spend a little more time in the Elfsong yet.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61028 = ~I'd not be standing here otherwise.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61029 = ~Then let's go. Stay close to me, Safana. The streets aren't safe for anyone, especially not a woman of your beauty.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61032 = ~If you insist. I'll await you here.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61033 = ~Apparently, <PRO_HESHE> can't. When you do, <CHARNAME>, let me know. I'm not going anywhere, apparently.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61034 = ~Out after curfew, boys. Not a smart thing for noble fellows like your esteemed selves to be doing.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61038 = ~Nothing to see here. Be on your way.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61039 = ~What're you lookin' at?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61040 = ~What's going on here?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61041 = ~From the sound of things, I'm looking at a gang of thugs engaged in a serious crime.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61042 = ~Nothing of any interest.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61043 = ~You there! Yes, you! I'll give you a purse of gold for each one of these Flaming Fist thugs you run off!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61044 = ~What's going on here?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61045 = ~These men and women protect this city and your fathers, boy. Show some respect.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61046 = ~I'll just take the gold, I don't really need a purse.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61047 = ~You'll need to give me more than that to cross the city's protectors.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61048 = ~Two purses, then!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61049 = ~Agreed. Be on your way, mercenaries.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61050 = ~Enjoy your beating, boys.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61051 = ~Help us! Help us, please! We weren't doing anything and these mercenaries attacked us!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61052 = ~Is that true, officer?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61053 = ~Calm yourself, lad. Tell me what's happening here.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61054 = ~I fail to see how that's any concern of mine.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61055 = ~The Flaming Fist has this matter in hand. Be on your way.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61056 = ~Awright, then. Sounds like it's time for us to register our displeasure with the lords 'n ladies o' the city—via some smug, prinkin' noblespawn faces!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61057 = ~That's no business of yours.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61058 = ~You aren't going to let them beat these kids, are you, <CHARNAME>?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61059 = ~Of course not. Begone, you sadistic lackwits! You've had your fun, now it's over.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61060 = ~That's precisely what I intend to do.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61061 = ~If I had more time to spare, I'd help them beat the spoilt brats.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61063 = ~Steady on, Rolff. This lot is nothing to be afraid of. They're mercenary scum. Our fathers eat people like this for breakfast.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61065 = ~Enjoy your beating, boys.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61066 = ~Unfortunately for you, your fathers aren't here right now. They're all yours, mercenary.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61069 = ~Thank you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. We are in your debt.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61071 = ~That's true. I believe your friend mentioned something about some gold in exchange for saving you?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61072 = ~So you are. Hand over all your money and we'll call it even.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61073 = ~Not for long. Give me everything you've got.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61074 = ~What? You can't do this!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61075 = ~You're right. I can't. But I hope you've learned a lesson here this <DAYNIGHTALL>.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61077 = ~I rather think I can.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61078 = ~Fine. But my father will hear of this, you can be sure of that. Come on, Rolff. Let's get out of here.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61079 = ~Here, please, take this gem as a token of our appreciation for your help.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61080 = ~What help? We had those louts right where we wanted them!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61081 = ~Shut up, Kieran. Just shut up.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61108 = ~What do you think you're looking at, huh?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61109 = ~Is everything all right here?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61110 = ~I'm reasonably sure I'm looking at someone I don't like. What's going on here?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61111 = ~Someone whose attitude will cost him dearly if it doesn't improve soon. Very soon. You seemed upset with this gentleman here. Why?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61112 = ~Someone who'd do well to walk away. Now.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61114 = ~Are you all right, sir? It sounded like you might be having a little trouble.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61115 = ~Is this mercenary bothering you?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61116 = ~Is there a problem here?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61123 = ~Are you all right, sir?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61124 = ~Done what, exactly? Does this involve that Fist soldier that was bothering you?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61127 = ~You seem... distraught. Would this have anything to do with that Flaming Fist mercenary who was bothering you?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61128 = ~Forgive me for saying so, but you don't SEEM fine.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61129 = ~If you insist. Enjoy the rest of your <DAYNIGHTALL>.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61134 = ~We are all doomed, in the end. Farewell.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61137 = ~I'll return when I've finished with him.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61138 = ~I am the hero of Baldur's Gate. Dealing with people like Riggs is what heroes of Baldur's Gate do, right? I think so.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61145 = ~You've been stealing from the people you were assigned to protect. There will be a reckoning for that.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61148 = ~There is nothing you can do for me, scum.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61152 = ~If you're smart, you're the one who'll start showing respect. The hero of Baldur's Gate is talking to you. And I'll be doing more than talk if you don't keep a civil tongue.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61153 = ~Ah, sorry, Captain. It's just—well, you know how it is out here.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61157 = ~You've got a good thing going here, Riggs. The problem is, it's not YOUR good thing.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61158 = ~I admire your drive, friend. I really do. It's inspired me to do something similar. Give me your purse.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61161 = ~Miscreants like you are no benefit to the Flaming Fist. Return what you have stolen, or pay the price.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61162 = ~You're probably right about that. Unfortunately for you, Duke Eltan isn't here.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61163 = ~But he can afford to dismiss a chicken.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61165 = ~What the hells does that mean?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61166 = ~It means you have a choice. Return what you have stolen, or pay the price.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61167 = ~Give me what you stole from these people and you'll never have to find out.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61170 = ~It means return what you've stolen or spend the rest of your life as a chicken. Given how hungry these people are, I don't think that life would be very long.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61173 = ~And the Flaming Fist serves the people. Return what you've stolen and I may not speak to your commanding officer about this breach of the public trust.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61177 = ~Enjoy the rest of your <DAYNIGHTALL>, officer.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61179 = ~You dare make that claim after what you've done? You serve nothing but your own avarice. And I'll not stand for it.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61181 = ~I can't do this to you and yet somehow, I am. Hand it over.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61183 = ~Worth fighting for, I'll tell you that much!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61185 = ~Then it looks like we got a problem. But I don't think we'll have one long!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61186 = ~I worked hard for what I got. You want it? Try and take it!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61187 = ~Yeah, right. Not much chance of that now...~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61191 = ~Is this the Iron Throne building?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61192 = ~Little enough. Certainly nothing that calls for such acrimony.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61193 = ~Don't take that tone with me, mercenary.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61194 = ~It was. Now it's home to the worthless scum that've overrun the city.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61195 = ~Try to put yourselves in their shoes, my friend. Don't be so quick to judge.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61196 = ~As opposed to the worthless scum that run the city?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61197 = ~They are not without value. The weak always have need of the strong, and the wise strong <PRO_MANWOMAN> can profit greatly from that.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61201 = ~Best show some respect, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. I serve the Flaming Fist. Be on your way.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61202 = ~Aye. You're right about that, I suppose. Have a good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61204 = ~You won't have to worry about him anymore. Here is the gold he stole from you and your fellow refugees. I hope I can trust you to return it to its rightful owners?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61205 = ~I dealt with him, and I got the gold he stole. And by a lucky coincidence, that was the exact amount of gold I'd have asked of you to retrieve it, so we can call it even. You're welcome.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61206 = ~I had words with him. Unfortunately, I was unable to convince him to return what he stole from you. I am very sorry.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61207 = ~I haven't yet, but I will, I assure you. Be patient, my friend.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61208 = ~Speak with whom about what...?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61209 = ~When I do, I will tell you. Until then, pester someone else.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61210 = ~Is this what Baldur's Gate calls a hero, then? We should have taken our chances with Caelar!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61211 = ~Oh, all right. If that's how you're going to be, here, take the gold. I trust you will see it returned to its rightful owners?~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61212 = ~Ow. That—that really hurts. It's a good thing I've all this gold I recently acquired to cheer me up. Without it, I might be moved to tears. Or extreme violence.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61213 = ~You have your life, Byzon. But you'll not have it long if you fail to show your superiors the proper respect.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61217 = ~Ah, yes. No, I haven't had a chance to speak with him yet, but I will, soon. I promise.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61218 = ~Damn me to all Nine Hells, I'd forgotten all about that. Right. I'll get on it immediately. Stay strong, friend.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61219 = ~All your money, you say? And his name is Riggs. I'll speak with him directly.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61220 = ~Show some backbone, man. Fight your own battles. I'll not fight them for you.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@61221 = ~Thank you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, thank you and bless you for your help. May Lathander look kindly upon you in all things.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

@61382 = ~Find Daeros

I put the spirit of Daeros Dragonspear to rest.

I found the ghost of Daeros Dragonspear and set him free. He's gone to the Fugue Plane to meet the spirit of his dragon friend, Halatathlaer.~

@61452 = ~Memories of Battles Past

Once I've talked to a few people about their experiences in battle, I can return to Warden Twoedged.

Vigilant Halasan is certainly dedicated to her profession. She's here to fight but also to make sure her soldiers come out of this alive—at least, as many as possible.~

I've concluded my time with Dosia.

I told Dosia the truth, that we should sequester the patients from the rest of the camp and let nature run its course. She didn't want to listen to reason, but I've done my duty as far as I can see.~

"Dear <CHARNAME>,

It took longer to collect the proper amount of gold than it should have, and far too long to return it to you. I cannot tell you how sincerely grateful I am for your patience in this matter. Here you should find all the monies owed you, plus an additional 17 gold pieces. I realize this small token in no way makes up for my my failure, but to try and find more would have been to delay repaying you even longer than I have already. I hope this finds you in good spirits and health. Thank you once again.

"Dearest Karella,

Our journey to the Shadow King's outpost has been long and treacherous. Trolls, hobgoblins, gnolls, xvarts, and even a gargoyle stood 'twixt us and our goal, but we have finally made it across Coast Way Crossing. If the map purloined from the Netherese vampire steers us true, we cannot be far from our goal.

Even if this venture proves as profitable as Walkins believes it will be (I'll believe that when I see it and perhaps not even then), there are many more dangers ahead. No property of the Shadow King will be left undefended. At a minimum, we are told to expect resistance from a small army of minor undead, which do not concern me overmuch, and a lich under the influence of the King's Overmind, which concerns me greatly.

Once these threats are dealt with, the going should become much easier. Along with the map, the vampire 'supplied' us with a key it claimed opens the door to the Shadow King's Inner Sanctum. It spoke of a treasure room hidden within, loaded with items of great power and value.

I send this letter to you in the hopes that it finds you in good health and that we will be together again soon—but however soon that may be, it cannot be soon enough for my taste. Until then, I remain yours,

Agda Coldhearth"~

1360 DR
We have seized the temple of the Lord of Murder. We killed many of Bhaal's clergy. Others escaped, but I claimed a prize for myself: the high priestess Madele. I have caged her while I decide what glorious things to do with her. Praise Cyric. Fear the Dark Sun.

1363 DR
I decided once again not to sacrifice Madele. I take too much pleasure from her madness. Instead, I removed her eyes and roasted them in a brazier as an offering to my lord Cyric. I ate them afterwards, their smoky, blistered jelly a delightful treat. The pathetic wretch continues to cry out to her dead god. I've filled her head with tales of Cyric's rise, and she believes my lord rules over all the darkened land (as someday he will!).

1365 DR
We have a pleasant routine, my Madele and I. Once a tenday I visit her, sometimes more, sometimes less. I have forgotten about her once or twice, and she's had to eat her own offerings of rats and lizards she murders in Bhaal's name. Then I spin my tales of Cyric's dominance until she works herself into a frenzy. Last week she actually collapsed in a fit, thrashing and choking. I watched her until it passed, letting her own body decide whether to kill her or not.

(The latest entry is dated one week ago.)

All his burglaries were undertaken with prayers to Mask, and he hoarded his stolen goods at a hidden altar to the god of thieves. He favored purple clothing, believing it was a color the god preferred, and he crafted this belt to match his ensemble. The thief was eventually caught and killed on one of his missions and the belt confiscated by the city guard. The next night, the belt vanished from a locked chest in the guardhouse, though, whisked away by Mask so that it could continue to serve the god's ends. Even today, the belt often finds its way into the path of those who will put it to good use.

Destroyer of Ancient Enemies: As is known, I have long laid claim to a singular mortal’s soul, one with divine—

Consumer of Souls: We know your plans well. How could they escape our notice? You’ve spoken of little BUT your return to the Prime Material plane ever since you returned to us.

She Who Walks: Let us not waste time reviewing THIS yet again. Shall we move on to the next item?

Destroyer: We will follow the agenda! That is the order of things and order guides us in all.

Lord of the Razor Peaks: Infinity weighs heavily on an unstimulated mind.

She Who Walks: Infinity, yes, but it’s been, what, a century by mortal reckoning? This continued obsession wearies me.

Destroyer: Perhaps changing circumstances will prove more intriguing than my “wearisome” ordeal. Another has claimed the soul I seek. The Exile is a mortal, yes, but he is possessed of dire power, sufficient even to threaten us.

\[Scribe’s Hand: A mortal powerful enough to challenge my master? This cannot be!\]

She Who Walks: He wouldn’t dare provoke our wrath.

Destroyer: Are you certain of that? He is IN Baldur’s Gate. He stalks MY prey.

Consumer of Souls: Such arrogance! He must know the Accord supports your claim.

Destroyer: He keeps his distance—for now. But if he seizes what is ours, you must be prepared to act as the terms of our alliance dictate.

\[Scribe’s Hand: They do not know, none of them know! When the Destroyer’s plans unfold, they will all appreciate his cunning!\]

She Who Walks: We have sworn with our blood to uphold this accord. If the Exile challenges one, he challenges all.

Consumer of Souls: Agreed.

Lord of the Razor Hills: The past is consumed as if in a fiery furnace. We must turn our gaze to the future.

She Who Walks: Indeed. Let us move on to the next item.

Destroyer: By all means.

\[Scribe’s Hand: They look at him and see a lowly worm, but the Destroyer is the strongest of them all! Soon everyone will know this truth, and I will say with pride that I serve him!\]~

@69235 = ~Hide armor is made from the thick hide of a very large animal (an elephant for example) or from many layers of normal leather from common animals, like cows. Hide armor is far too bulky, inflexible and heavy to be used much in advanced human cultures. However, among the barbaric humanoid masses throughout the dark forests and misty jungles of the world, hide armor is common. Even though it does offer more protection than leather armor, one must get by the offensive odor and shoddy appearance in order to wear it effectively. Even though Thieves can wear this armor, it has a negative effect on their abilities. This armor is enchanted, granting the wearer additional protection.

@69597 = ~When asked about her past, Schael Corwin reluctantly admits she ran wild as a child on the streets of Baldur's Gate. Her rebelliousness soon got her into trouble with the Flaming Fist.

Left alone in a cell with nothing but her thoughts for company, she began to reflect on the decisions she'd made in the past and see where they would inevitably take her. When she was eventually freed, she decided to change the direction of her life. She enlisted in the Flaming Fist and rose quickly through the ranks.

You sense there is little Schael Corwin would not do for her family or for the Flaming Fist.~

@69598 = ~When asked about his past, DORN IL-KHAN shows little interest in sharing details of his past. That he serves a demonic master is no secret, but beyond his dedication to his patron, Ur-Gothoz, Dorn says nothing about himself. From offhand comments and insinuations, you gather that the half-orc suffered some painful betrayal in the past, an offense he has neither forgiven nor forgotten.

According to Dorn, Ur-Gothoz commanded him to seek out and destroy an individual at the crusader camp during the ceremony of the Enlightenment. Dorn attempted this task but was thwarted and imprisoned instead. He now longs for vengeance against those who dared to cage him.~

@69599 = ~When asked about her past, DYNAHEIR tells you only that she journeys on a private mission. Her goals, whatever they are, appear to line up with yours, and she seems happy to travel at your side.

Dynaheir and her bodyguard, Minsc, come from the nation of Rashemen. Occasionally, they speak of their home. Dynaheir belongs to an order of spellcasters known as the Witches of Rashemen, ferocious enemies of the Red Wizards of Thay. The very mention of the hated Red Wizards brings a spark to Dynaheir's eyes and a snap to her voice.~

@69600 = ~When asked about his past, Edwin mutters darkly that you already know more than is good for you. Edwin mutters quite often to himself, apparently preferring his own conversation to that of others.

Despite his eccentricities, Edwin is a powerful and intelligent mage, as evidenced by his membership in the Red Wizards of Thay. Edwin grudgingly admits that he and several other Red Wizards were on a journey when they were waylaid and pressed into service by Caelar's crusade. Two of his allies joined the crusade, and a third was slain. Edwin escaped, vowing vengeance on Caelar.

He frequently refers to the Shining Lady as "witch," an obvious slur given that the Red Wizards' hated enemies include the Witches of Rashemen.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@69601 = ~When asked about his past, GLINT GARDNERSONSON tends to use three words where one will do and constantly breaks off on tangents as he speaks. Eventually, you learn that he comes from a large family and has always been seen as something of a troublemaker. He gained his nickname, "Three-Eyes," when his exasperated mother exclaimed that she needed three eyes to keep watch on him.

Glint happily expounds on his many adventures since leaving home; it's difficult to tell where reality ends and exaggeration begins. Though Glint initially ventured from Baldur's Gate in search of several missing relatives, he seems to have been caught up in the mission of ending Caelar's crusade.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@69603 = ~When asked about his past, Khalid nervously reveals that he was born and raised in the nation of Calimshan. From offhand comments he makes, you gather he was not favored by either of his parents but particularly not by his father. Khalid joined the city militia as soon as he was able and made his career there for a time.

He leaves the details of how he met Jaheira unclear, but you know he and his wife both belong to a secretive order known as the Harpers. Their appearance at Bridgefort just as the crusade arrived may not have been coincidence, but Khalid anxiously denies the Harpers sent him to stop the crusade.~

@69604 = ~When asked about her past, M'Khiin grunts and says you'll sleep easier if you don't know her story.

Eventually, she shares with you that her goblin tribe was a vicious and brutal one. As a shaman, M'Khiin commanded some degree of respect, but her abilities also brought her a maturity the other goblins lacked. She wanted desperately to escape from the cruelty of her life, but the other goblins valued her abilities too much to let her go.

One night, a goblin scouting party came across a deer caught in a thicket of brambles. They killed the animal and carried it triumphantly back to camp. M'Khiin waited until the others had stuffed themselves on raw meat and fallen into a post-meal stupor, then crept away.

She's been on her own ever since and has found herself persecuted by humans at every turn. She joined Baeloth Barrityl with the understanding that she would be presented as an "exhibit" but not made to actually fight—a promise Baeloth broke the minute the opportunity presented itself.~

// dejemma -> dajemma; also surplus spaces after "undergo." and "direction."
@69605 = ~MINSC proudly proclaims himself a berserker warrior from the nation of Rashemen. He is currently undertaking his dajemma, a ritual journey all young Rashemi men undergo.

His companion Dynaheir, whom he protects as part of his mission, is never far from his side. Dynaheir apparently has some interest in seeing the crusade stopped, and Minsc will follow wherever she leads. Indeed, "his witch," as Minsc calls her, is one of the few people from whom he will take direction.

He also gives great weight to the "words" of his miniature giant space hamster, Boo. Neither you nor your other companions can hear Boo speak. It's possible Minsc has taken too many blows to the head. Still, his great strength and berserker rage should prove a danger to the crusaders you encounter.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@69606 = ~When asked about her past, NEERA says little. She alludes to an "interesting" childhood as her wild magic powers developed, as well as a difficult time pursued by Red Wizards who wanted to study her and kill her (not necessarily in that order). She seems more interested in the future—preferably a future where a fellow wild mage named Adoy no longer speaks in her mind.

The constant voice nattering away in her head is clearly driving the young half-elf to distraction. She seems willing to battle the entire crusade at once if it will get Adoy out of her head.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 2  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1 | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 3
@69607 = ~When asked about his past, Rasaad speaks sorrowfully about losing his brother, Gamaz, to the Shadow Thieves of Athkatla. He attempts to put that tragedy behind him through his worship of Selûne and his commitment to the Order of the Sun Soul.

After the events of the iron crisis, Rasaad decided his calling was to serve those less fortunate than himself. The refugees entering Baldur's Gate required a great deal of assistance. Rasaad volunteered to run a refugee camp out of the old Iron Throne building.

After some reflection, though, Rasaad decided that putting a stop to the crusade was an equally important goal, and set off for Dragonspear Castle to do so.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@69608 = ~When asked about her past, Safana spins tale upon tale involving fantastic liaisons with pirate captains, nobles, and royalty of all shapes and sizes. Her most recent escapades seem to be truthful; she took up with an elf named Coran, and while the relationship seemed amusing for a time, she and Coran recently parted ways. She confides to you that Coran was "just too much. Wouldn't stop hanging off me in the most pathetic way."

Always on the lookout for the next exciting adventure—and perhaps needing to leave Baldur's Gate for a reason she hasn't shared—Safana joined the expedition to Dragonspear for "as long as it remains amusing."~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 2  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1 | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 3
@69609 = ~When asked about her past, Viconia snaps that there is nothing about her you need to know. Over time, you've learned that Viconia is a drow from the city of Menzoberranzan, though she left her home some time ago for unspecified reasons.

Life on the surface has been hard for Viconia. She turned away from the traditional drow worship of Lolth and instead venerates Shar, goddess of darkness and loss. Viconia still finds the customs and mannerisms of surface-dwellers strange and takes malicious amusement in watching others struggle to decide how best to deal with her.

Traveling with you has afforded Viconia some measure of protection, and she seems content, for the time being, to remain in your company during the march to Dragonspear Castle.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 2  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1 | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 3
@69610 = ~When asked about his past, Voghiln speaks at considerable length of his travels in the North. Originally from Luskan, Voghiln felt the call of adventure and set out on a journey to the Spine of the World. For the next few years, he traveled among the northernmost countries, including Vaasa and the Silver Marches, building up his repertoire and his reputation as a skald.

Near the story's end, Voghiln hastily glosses over a bit where he decided to travel south for a time. No amount of persuasion convinces him to reveal why he truly left the North. Instead, Voghiln said, he came north chasing new adventures and new "womans."

Despite his fondness for drink and his propensity for chasing skirts, Voghiln is a brave and talented companion who is eager to see the crusade come to an end—mostly so that he can write about it.~

An orc fleeing the site of the battle snatched the fragment up as she ran. This she gave to her tribe's shaman, who immediately recognized its power and fashioned it into an amulet.

The Heart of the Mountain is of particular use to those who do the Ghost Dance. Such folk dwell at least partly in the realm of the spirits; the amulet forges a stronger connection 'twixt them and the earth, lending its wearer strength in the face of physical adversity.

I've learned much by speaking with others in the coalition camp.

Everyone has their own reason for joining in the struggle against Caelar's crusade. Though they have many different motives for taking up arms against the Shining Lady, all share the same ultimate goal.~

@71221 = ~Very well. If it cannot be, then it cannot be.~

@71222 = ~That's it! You found it!~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1

@71229 = ~You changed your name?~

@71230 = ~I don't need to hear more.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@71254 = ~These marks have the look of a lion, but lions are not so large nor are they common in this area. We should be cautious.~

Fashioned as a weapon for Tempus's priests, who cannot use their deity's favored weapon due to its bladed edge, Blazing Glory has a black iron tip studded with points of alternating gold and ruby. Enchantments harden these points and add a flash of fire with every blow. The wielder of Blazing Glory never tires in battle, fortified by the will of the Lord of Battles himself.
