As much as you have traveled, these last few feet to the surface have seemed the longest trek by far.

No matter, you have done what you came to do. Let them glare if they wish. Perhaps one day you will return and reward their suspicions. They will be weak for some time...

You return to your travels, making sure that those you meet never forget your passing. Fear and respect is all that you ask, for you are deserving of both. The battle with Irenicus gave you a greater understanding of yourself, and strangely enough, the world appears to respond readily. More of life matches your dark demeanor, and why should it not? You were the Slayer, you conquered a portion of Hell itself, and you crushed everyone that stood in your path.

And wherever you go, people stand aside. You have gained great power, and no one will ever take it from you again.~ [NARR05]

@1763 = ~As you leave Suldanessellar, you are nearly overwhelmed by the cheering of the assembled crowds. There is open gratitude on the faces of the elves, and many times you are encouraged to stop and receive gifts or shake hands. There is an obvious lament at your departure, as well as an expectation of your return. They consider you a hero and, for once, you really feel the part.

You pass into the Forest of Tethir, wondering if there could have been a future for you in the city that you have left behind. You examine the amulet around your neck, studying the images of elven gods inlaid in the platinum, and you feel the warm tingle of the item's magic. This gift will remind you of how welcome a visitor you would be—but it also bears witness to the fact that you are without a true home, a place where you belong. You could return to Athkatla, you think, but deep inside, you feel the taint that yet remains in your soul.

There can be no home for you yet, as hard as that is to admit, so you venture deeper into the forest, pondering the words of demons and growing annoyed at how destiny holds its secrets from your view.~ [NARR04]

@2969 = ~Invisibility
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 2
Range: Touch
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes the creature touched to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or its gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. The caster cannot perform any actions that manipulate the environment around <PRO_HIMHER>, such as opening doors, disarming a trap, or opening a chest. The caster can, however, cast defensive spells on <PRO_HIMHER>self and fellow party members. And if <PRO_HESHE> attacks, <PRO_HESHE> immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables <PRO_HIMHER> to attack first.~

Level: 3
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

By casting this spell and laying <PRO_HISHER> hand upon a creature, the priest heals 14 points of wound or other injury damage from the creature's body. This healing cannot affect creatures without corporeal bodies, nor can it cure wounds of creatures not living or of extraplanar origin. Curing is permanent only insofar as the creature does not sustain further damage; caused wounds will heal—or can be cured—just as any normal injury.~

@7285 = ~History of Calimshan:

Calimshan is older than either of the other Empires of the Sands, first settled over 7,000 years ago by the Djen, a humanoid race from the Elemental Plane of Air. These Djen were known to be very magical, and during the course of their rule they developed many new spells previously not available in the Plane of Air.

The Djen prospered for over 1,000 years in Calimshan, but their reign was ended by an invasion of creatures and minions from the Plane of Fire. Some say this is where the bitter hatred between djinni and efreeti started, though others contend this was just a result of a hatred that was already there. Whatever the cause, the battle was long and bloody, and took over 100 years to complete. The Djen finally routed the attackers, but were greatly weakened in the attempt. They slowly declined, and the last mention of the Djen is just under 6,000 years old.

For the next 4,000 years Calimshan was dominated by nomadic tribes of humans. Tribes from various places—Chult, the Shaar, The Shining Plains, Chondath, even Amn and Cormyr—took turns dominating, only to be conquered by the next, nearly identical tribe.

Slowly, the nomadic nature of Calimshan began to change. As explorers and traders from Amn, Waterdeep, and Cormyr discovered the wonders of the area, some tribes began to settle down and develop new means of support, like fishing, farming, or trading. These communities began to band together for mutual protection, and soon a civilization was born. It was only 1,300 years ago that the Shoon Empire (now called Iltkazar) came into being.

The Shoons were a grand and glorious empire, and their excesses were the foundation of Calishite snobbery today. They grew wise and powerful in the ways of magic, and ships and caravans bearing the Shoon flag traveled across the realms. Shoon himself, a particularly powerful mage, created a book of great power during this time called the Tome of the Unicorn. The exact location of the Tome has been lost in time, but since the book is 2' by 3' and made of pure metal, it is likely to still be around... somewhere.

900 years ago the Shoon empire abruptly vanished. A great magical upheaval was suspected at first, but learned mages of other lands dispute the claim. A force that great they say, would have disturbed magical powers and beings throughout the realms, and that didn't happen. Sages who have studied the Shoon at great length have reached no definite conclusions, but the most popular theories today center around a plague or disease that decimated the population.

Today, the Shoon impact on Calimshan is still great. The grandeur of that empire is responsible, more than anything else, for the strong national character of Calimshan today. The ruins of the Shoon's greatest city, Monrativi Teshy Mir, can still be found in the wilderness to the west of the edge of the Forest of Mir (see below for more on Monrativi Teshy Mir).

Since the fall of Shoon, no force or people has risen to solely dominate the land. There are a half dozen or so major cities, each of which exerts its own power over its own area. About 170 years ago, a man in Calimport amassed a large army and declared himself "Pasha" over the land. Before that army could march, however, the representatives of each major city met and agreed to recognize the Pasha's authority in limited areas, and to pay a small tribute to him; enough to pay for the works the Pasha was expected to do. The oldest son of each pasha inherits the title; if there is no son, the mayors of each large city select a new one. The current Pasha, Rashid Djenispool, has ruled for over 18 years, and is the grandson of a pasha elected by the mayors of Calimshan 44 years ago.~

@7287 = ~History of Gondegal the Lost King:

Arabel, long under the dominion of Cormyr, for a time became the center of a swordsman's empire. This swordsman was Gondegal, the Lost King, who in the Year of the Dragon (1352 DR) attempted to carve a kingdom for himself centered on Arabel. It was to extend north to the Desertsmouth Mountains, south and west of Wyvernwater and the farms outlying from Eveningstar, and east to Tilver's Gap and the mountain passes.

In the years following, people would say that Gondegal's reach was no longer than his blade. He could not hold any of the territory against the might of Cormyr, Sembia, Daggerdale, Tilverton, and several of the other Dales—all of whom he drew the blood and ire of in the making of his throne.

Gondegal ruled for less than a season, though he reigned officially for scarcely eight days. The remainder of his rule was spent fighting here and there against one foe or another in the lands he claimed. His troops were largely mercenary, and his treasury of seized goods was small and soon gone. One night Gondegal's force simply melted away before the advancing troops of Cormyr, and was gone. King Azoun IV retook Arabel on that morn without wetting a blade.

No one has ever found the body of Gondegal; he is known to have fled north and then east via Teshwave, but then his fate becomes a matter of conflicting rumor and legend. Some believe he still lives with a score or more of loyal followers, keeping court in the wilds somewhere, a careful and ruthless bandit who takes care that none survive his attacks to carry tales anywhere. When entire caravans vanish at times anywhere between the High Dale and far-off Impiltur, he is blamed by talk in the taverns.

Gondegal was said to be a tall, gray-haired warrior of considerable personal skill and intelligence. His badge was a gray wolf's head, face on, with red eyes. Caravan guards often warn merchants to beef up the escort on a particular caravan, "else thy gold'll soon be gilding Gondegal's throne." Gondegal was an impeccable swordsman and somewhat chaotic in his self-professed neutral alignment. If he does indeed yet live, the magic or treasure he carries, and who his allies might be, are all unknown.

Gondegal's reign had a great influence on the King of Cormyr, at that time in his second decade of rule. Not only was Azoun forced to put down an effective rebellion in his own country, he was forced to pay more attention to matters outside Suzail, to become the ruler of a nation as opposed to a city-state. Further, the bloodless assault on Arabel was Azoun's first true experience at the head of his army, and the joy of "freeing" the people of Arabel is one that remains with him.~

@7288 = ~History of the Chosen of Mystra:

The reason why Mystra, the Goddess of Magic, invested a portion of her divine might in mortals is not known. One of the more popular theories, and one that is gaining more support in light of the goddess' other actions during that period, is that Mystra foresaw the Time of Troubles (and her own passing at the hands of Helm) and chose to give some of her power to mortals in order to ensure that her successor (the female mage Midnight, as it turned out) would have a number of nearly immortal allies in the struggle against the schemes of the gods (the now dead Bane, Myrkul, and Bhaal) who precipitated the Time of Troubles by stealing the Tablets of Fate. The theory goes on to suggest that Mystra informed Azuth at approximately the Year of the Rising Flame (0 DR), more than 1,300 years before the Time of Troubles, that some of her power must be put into the hands of mortals who would then become known as Mystra's Chosen. This power would sleep within the bodies of those mortals, allowing Mystra to call on it only with their permission. It would give the Chosen the innate ability to heal quickly, and would give them life spans far greater than those of ordinary mortals. Mystra speculated that these mortals might be able to call on her power and thereby gain some special abilities, but that these powers would not rival those of a deity. (See "Powers" below.)

The Goddess of All Magic then began to select mortals she thought to be suitable. One of the first was the young mage Elminster, and she also singled out a promising wizard named Khelben Arunsun. Both have proved to be worthy and capable receptacles of her power, but Mystra's other early attempts to invest her power in living humans were unsuccessful, and she came to realize that only very few mortals were of stern enough substance to contain such power within themselves without being destroyed or corrupted. Even though some people aside from Elminster and Khelben may have possessed the requisite strength, it is possible that having lived for years prior to being visited by Mystra had set them on a path from which they were not able to deviate. Whatever the reason, the problem needed to be solved. To get around the difficulty, Mystra devised a plan to use herself as a vessel to breed individuals who could be nurtured and acclimated to her power from the very beginnings of their lives.

For the father of these individuals, she picked the best example of human stock she could find: Domal Silverhand, a nobleman and a former Harper who lived near Neverwinter. Mystra then possessed the body of Elue Shundar, a half-elven sorceress whom Dornal was already attracted to. Mystra revealed her presence and her plan to Elue, who happily and eagerly agreed to have the goddess share her body. Elue had been reluctant, but under the influence of Mystra the woman became a seductress, and Domal found his advances being suddenly returned with great fervor.

Dornal and Mystra/Elue were wed in the Year of Drifting Stars (760 DR). The first of seven daughters, Anastra Sylune, was born the following winter. Sylune's six sisters emerged at one-year intervals thereafter: Endue Alustriel, Ambara Dove, Ethena Astorma (she prefers the shortened "Storm" these days), Anamanue Laeral, Alassra Shentrantra (known today as the Simbul), and Er'sseae Qilue. These siblings have become known in Realmsian lore as the Seven Sisters.

Domal, who had been kept in the dark about his wife's true nature through the years (presumably because Mystra didn't want to risk losing his services), was disappointed and nearly distraught by the time his sixth child was born; He had always wanted sons as well as daughters. More importantly, he was seeing his wife deteriorate right before his eyes. The strain of coexisting with the goddess all these years had turned Elue into a withered shell—in essence a lich, clinging to life only because Mystra's power was within her.

When Elue was carrying the seventh child, Dornal consulted a priest who told him his wife had been possessed by an entity of great magical power. To spare both of them any further agony, he attempted to slay his wife's physical form by severing her head from her body.

As soon as he had done this, Mystra was forced to reveal herself to him, and she went on to explain her scheme. Just as she had worried would happen, Dornal was aghast at how he and his wife had been used by the goddess. He turned his back on the corpse of his wife, abandoned his lands and his children, and vanished into the North. Mystra bore him no ill will, and in fact protected him for the final 30 years of his life. When Domal finally did meet his end he called out to Mystra, and the goddess granted him continued existence as her servant. Now known as the Watcher, Domal Silverhand travels the world unseen by mortals on a continuing mission to locate candidates to swell the ranks of the Chosen and to identify possible threats to Mystra and her minions.~

@7289 = ~History of Shadowdale—The Fall of Azmaer, Last Drow Marshall of the Twisted Tower:

The drow rule of Shadowdale lasted until the early 900s Dale Reckoning, when the increased human population in the area brought the dark elves into conflict with their now more numerous neighbors. The humans were the Dalesmen who a millennium earlier had crossed the Dragon Reach and made peace with the elves of Myth Drannor, settling at the borders of the great woods that was the elven home. The drow soon found themselves under continual attack, and most of those who held overground settlements retreated back below. The last powerful drow leader was Azmaer, the marshal of the Twisted Tower in its last drow-held days. Azmaer oversaw the last retreat of the drow holdings in the face of a human uprising, and held the citadel against a year-long siege. With supplies and slaves brought up from the Underdark directly into the tower, the drow could have conceivably held out forever; However, a human slave (family histories in the Dales indicate a number of possible individuals) poisoned the well in the Tower and the citadel was easily overrun. Azmaer's body was not found among the dead, leading some to believe that he escaped back into the depths to rejoin his people. Noting the fact that he would have had to explain to his matriarch how he lost Shadowdale, it is much more likely that, should Azmaer have survived, he went into voluntary exile, hiding from both human and drow. Given that this occurred only 400 years ago, it is certainly possible that Azmaer still lives.~

The past hundred years have been an example of the best and worst of the lords of Shadowdale. All have been nonnative to the Dalelands, though all made the land their home. A century ago the lord of the Dales was one Joadath, a stiff-necked agnostic who denied the power of any god, good or evil, and used force to back up his beliefs. During this time there was a great deal of religious persecution, including a massacre of Tyrists on Watcher's Knoll. Joadath was eventually killed by a beast of the nether planes summoned by parties unknown, which then proceeded to rampage through the Dale. The beast was killed and Shadowdale rescued by the spellcasters Aumry and Sylune. Aumry was proclaimed lord by acclamation.~

Lord Aumry was assassinated by Zhentarim agents, who in turn were captured and killed by the warrior Jyordhan. Jyordhan, with the Pendant of Ashaba in hand(the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), proceeded to present himself as the new lord, and was so acclaimed by the people. It was unknown to the people that Jyordhan was also an agent of the Zhentarim, and that the entire proceeding had actually been a ruse.

Jyordhan abandoned the Twisted Tower, instead establishing himself in Castle Krag east of Shadowdale. His court was soon overrun with agents of the Black Network. When the people eventually revolted, Zhentil Keep sent peace-keeping forces to maintain Jyordhan's rule. Sylune, now aware of the deception but a firm pacifist, did her best to keep the Dale healthy and intact during Jyordhan's evil rule.~

Lord Jyordhan's rule of Shadowdale ended when he encountered Khelben Arunsun, also called the Blackstaff. The story at the time was that Jyordhan accepted an invitation from Khelben to visit Waterdeep, and there he took ill and died. In reality, Jyordhan ambushed Khelben as the mage was leaving Shadowdale, and the Blackstaff killed him. In either case, Khelben took hold of the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales) and returned to Waterdeep with it, promising to send a suitable candidate for lordship to the Dales. Jyordhan had ruled for five years, and without his advocacy, Castle Krag was abandoned and the Zhentil Keep troops routed. Jyordhan's previously chosen successor was a Melvauntan named Lyran, but without the Pendant this individual was considered a pretender to the throne.~

This acclamation of the people has formed the basis for choosing the lord of Shadowdale since the routing of the evil Lord Jyordhan by Khelben Blackstaff. Usually a predecessor will step down as opposed to dying in office, and his chosen successor will be approved by the populace at large. This system has had its drawbacks, as will be shown below, but in general, it has served the independent, self-willed people of the Dale very well. They have avoided the "genetic lottery of which good bureaucracies and bad kingships are made" (a quote from the venerable Elminster). The symbol of the lordship is the Pendant of Ashaba, a device owned by the original wizard, and used to determine the rightful lord of the Dale.~

During the period when Khelben Blackstaff held the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), Sylune (wife of the murdered Lord Aumry) was the de facto ruler of Shadowdale, though these years were known as the Time of No Lords. Sylune and an adventuring company known as Mane's Band were responsible for driving out the Zhentil Keep forces and keeping at bay the monsters in the area. The Twisted Tower, the traditional seat of leadership, remained uninhabited following its abandonment by the evil Lord Jyordhan, and neither Sylune nor the companions of Mane's Band wished to assume the mantle of leader. With time, Mane's Band passed on to other lands and adventures.~

@7297 = ~History of Shadowdale—Doust Sulwood Becomes Lord of Shadowdale:

Three winters following his defeat of the evil Lord Jyordhan, Khelben Blackstaff found a suitable candidate to assume leadership of the Dales, or rather a group of candidates. They were the Knights of Myth Drannor, so named to show their interest in the elven territories and their connection with the elven peoples, and Khelben gave them the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the Lordship) in return for services rendered to himself and to Shadowdale. Their leader, the ranger Florin Falconhand, refused the honor of the lordship. It was therefore passed to Doust Sulwood, who was made the new lord with the support of Florin and Sylune (wife of the murdered Lord Aumry), and apparently also the secret support of Khelben as well.

Doust reoccupied the Twisted Tower, driving out the last agents of the Black Network. He also re-instituted many of Ashaba's democratic ideals, including the Lord's Court where all citizens may speak freely and air their grievances without threat of reprisal. Doust ruled for five years and proved to be a capable ruler, beloved by the people. The regular presence of the Knights of Myth Drannor did much to ensure the protection of the area, particularly against incursions by Lyran Nanther the Pretender. Lyran was to have been Jyordhan's named replacement, but with the Zhentarim routed there is little validity to the claim.~

It is of note that during the time that Doust Sulwood of the Knights of Myth Drannor assumed the role of Lord of Shadowdale, Elminster took up residence in the area. A semi-regular visitor up to that time, he took possession of a low, abandoned tower at the foot of the Old Skull, and declared himself to be officially in retirement. The nature of that retirement varies from active involvement in local affairs to long-term vacations on other planes. The natives of the Dale have come to the understanding that they cannot always count on the powerful mage being in residence in times of need or danger, but when he is present in these circumstances his aid is usually given.~

Doust Sulwood, recommended to the position by Khelben Blackstaff, ruled Shadowdale as lord for five years. "Seems like a millennium," he was oft known to have reported, and the tedium of court life and the lure of adventure eventually caused him to retire his position and rejoin the Knights of Myth Drannor in regular adventuring. He handed the Pendant of Ashaba (symbol of the Lordship) on to one of the younger Knights, a Waterdhavian noble named Mourngrym Amcathra. Mourngrym had been dispatched by Khelben from Waterdeep for other purposes, but Doust liked both the young man's straightforward honesty and his willingness to shoulder the burden of protecting the small community from myriad dangers. Time has proven this choice a wise one.~

@7300 = ~History of Shadowdale—Shaerl and Mourngrym Meet and Marry:

The implications of Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun "choosing" the last two lords of Shadowdale (Doust Sulwood and Mourngrym Amcathra) were not lost on the Dale's powerful neighbor to the south, Cormyr. An agent was sent northward to divine Mourngrym's true intentions and to guarantee the Dale's continued good relationship with the throne of the Purple Dragon. The agent was a rogue named Shaerl Rowanmantle, sent by Vangerdahast (though all paperwork on this matter has been curiously incinerated in Suzail, so all is hearsay and tale). Shaerl discovered more than she intended and fell in love with young Mourngrym. The two married and became the lord and lady of Shadowdale. Shaerl's loyalty is now to her husband and to the land they co-rule. This was probably not the intention of the Cormyreans.~

@7301 = ~History of Shadowdale—Mourngrym's Rule:

Since being recommended to the position by outgoing Lord Doust Sulwood, Lord Mourngrym Amcathra's rule of Shadowdale has been less peaceful than he had hoped. The First Battle of Shadowdale occurred in the Year of the Prince (1357 DR), and involved Daleland forces routing those of Lyran the Pretender. Lyran has made repeated attempts to gain the Lordship, as was intended by the former Zhentish puppet, Lord Jyordhan. While significant, this battle pales when compared to the larger battle fought on the same site between Bane-led Zhentil Keep forces and the Dales during the Time of Troubles (1358 DR/0 PR). When the Battle of Shadowdale is referred to (without a number), it usually means this second battle. In addition, Mourngrym has had to deal with a large number of skirmishes, incursions, a possible invasion from below, explosions, and other sundry disasters.

Mourngrym and Shaerl have one child, Scotti, who is now nine winters old. By the customs of the area, he is not considered the heir apparent, and another suitable warrior or mage may take the reins of power of the small community. Most feel that Mourngrym will hold the Pendant until his son has reached his majority, then abdicate in young Scotti's favor once he takes his grown name. If this happens, it will be the first occasion of the lordship of Shadowdale passing down through a family.~

@7302 = ~History of the North—The First Flowering:

For millennia, gold elves dwelt in Illefarn (where Waterdeep now stands) and Eaerlann (along the River Shining). From their ornate forest cities, they traded with emerging human nations like Netheril and Illusk and repulsed the attacks of the goblin races. Meanwhile, dwarven clans united as the nation of Delzoun, named for the dwarf who forged the union. The nation, existing primarily underground, extended from the Ice Mountains to the Nether Mountains. Silver Moon Pass was its western border and the Narrow Sea its eastern shore. Orcs came from north of the Spine of the World but were turned back in great slaughter by the elves. To this day, this is the homeland and stronghold for orcs and similar races.~

@7303 = ~History of the North—The Crown Wars:

Humans immigrated in bands from the Shining Sea and up to the Sword Coast. They became seafarers, striking out across the waves to the Moonshaes, Mintarn, Ruathym, and the northern islands. Elves engaged in an unceasing war against each other, with the humans and orcs taking over the resulting ruins. Perhaps the greatest calamity to befall the Fair Folk was the Dark Disaster, a killing magic that took the form of a dark, burning cloud. It enshrouded the kingdom of Miyeritar, and when it faded away some months later, not an elf lived—nor were trees left, only an open, blasted moor: the High Moor.

All was not dark for the elves. Although in retreat, as barbarian humans and orc hordes grew in strength, their power rose in the Elven Court and Evereska (remaining a stronghold to this day). They conceived of cooperation between dwarves, kindly humans, and other elves for mutual survival against orcs, marauding humans, and the tide of beasts (ogres, bugbears, trolls, goblins, gnolls, and other nonhuman creatures) led by the rising power of giants. Astonishingly, in at least three places—the Fallen Kingdoms and the cities of Silverymoon and Myth Drannor—they succeeded with shining grace.

To the east, on the sandy shores of the calm and shining Narrow Sea, human fishing villages grew into small towns and then joined together as the nation of Netheril. Sages believe the fishing towns were unified by a powerful human wizard who had discovered a book of great magic power that had survived from the Days of Thunder—a book that legend calls the Nether Scrolls. Under this nameless wizard and those who followed, Netheril rose in power and glory, becoming both the first human land in the North and the most powerful. Some say this discovery marked the birth of human wizardry, since before then, mankind had only shamans and witch doctors. For over three thousand years, Netheril dominated the North, but even its legendary wizards were unable to stop their final doom.~

@7304 = ~History of the Bell in the Depths:

One of the great and mysterious sites in the Moonsea area, the Bell in the Depths, is connected with legendary Northkeep, an island kingdom that was the first great citadel of humankind in these cold lands. Northkeep was of great and magical city, and it was under the protection of these magics that humanity first began to press back the orc hordes and take command or the sea.

The power of Northkeep made it an obvious target for orcs, giants, and other evil races, however these creatures were not inclined towards sea actions, and Northkeep seemed safe until the day when (according to legend) 40,000 inhuman mages, shamans, witch doctors, and priests of all foul races gathered on the northern shore of the Moonsea and began to chant, bringing the vengeance of their gods down upon the human interlopers. The gods (at least some of them) came and destroyed their priests for disturbing them, but also sank Northkeep beneath the waves.

The upper reaches of Northkeep—its slender, now-broken spires—can be seen beneath the water by boats that sail nearby. This is not attempted often, however, as the region is said to be haunted by the original defenders of Northkeep, seeking company in their watch over the Cold Lands. On fog-ridden nights the bells of the tallest towers, despite being submerged, can be heard as far away as Hillsfar.~

@7305 = ~History of the Red Ravens:

One of the few long-standing mercenary companies that operate in Cormyr, the Red Ravens have a strength on paper of 110 swords, but can easily triple that number with new hires if they get a sufficiently large contract. They have been kept on retainer by the government of Cormyr with the stated purpose of cleaning out the Stonelands to the north. They have been moderately successful in this goal, but the Stonelands are still far from being a safe territory.

The Red Ravens are commanded by Rayanna the Rose, a veteran of the Horde crusade. They are noted for their honesty and trustworthiness, as they don not wish to jeopardize their royal charter. Most of their troops are armed with studded leather and carry long swords. They charge 200 gold pieces per week for the services of their 110-being unit. Their symbol is a red raven amulet.~

@7307 = ~History of Luiren, Land of the Halflings:

The halflings of Luiren claim that it is the original homeland of halflings in the realms. Although other halflings may disagree with this, it is true that Luiren was settled hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years ago.

Luiren's history is one of conquerors and subjugation. Throughout the centuries, the halflings have been conquered by the barbarians who used to inhabit Dambrath, by the kingdom of Estagund, and even once by the monsters of Beldorn. In every case, the invaders were eventually defeated because they made the mistake of underestimating the halflings due to their small stature. A good bit of mischief, mayhem, and general trouble-making by the halflings also helped end the occupations.

Currently, Luiren is enjoying unprecedented prosperity. The halflings are currently taking advantage of their relationship with the nation of Durpar; their biggest customer and greatest competitor. Also, through these close ties with Durpar, Luiren has protected itself against another Dambraii invasion. The rulers of Dambrath must know that if they begin to expand to the east, they will arouse the ire of Durpar, as well as Var and Estagund. The threat of a trade embargo and/or military consequences have kept this aggressive nation away from the Luireners.~

@7309 = ~History of the North—Recent History of the North:

In the waning summer months of 1367, an immense orc horde descended from the Spine of the World, intent on winding its way south into the trade lands of the North. This force of orcs, led by King Greneire, surged its way south between the Moonwood and the Cold Wood, stopping just outside the Citadel of Many Arrows.

King Obould, orc ruler of the Citadel of Many Arrows, was terrified at the prospect of another orc horde, despite the fact that he knew they should be working together against the humans of the North and the spawn of Hellgate Keep. His tribal shamans, however, had been predicting a treacherous fall of the citadel—and they'd told the king that he'd be disposed by other orcs.

Thus, it was a dark day when King Greneire and his horde of 150,000 orcs appeared on the plains outside the Citadel of Many Arrows. King Obould announced to his followers that this horde had been sent to dislodge them from their home and send them out to be scavengers among the plains. He vowed that, as Gruumsh as his witness, the Citadel of Many Arrows would slaughter these treacherous orcs "like elves during a festival."

For four months, the forty-thousand orcs within the citadel held their ground. Assault after assault was mounted against the high walls of the garrison, but the attacking orcs were losing far more than the defenders. Still, the living conditions within the walls—never too good to begin with—created losses of their own.

The battle for the Citadel of Many Arrows culminated during the first week of Uktar. As another light blanket of snow sought to bury the gathered orcs, King Greneire threw his entire remaining army at the citadel, bursting its gates and pitting orc against orc in a flurry of swords. As the two orc kings sought one another out along the ramparts, the citadel began to burn.

The orcs that survive the battle still speak of the extraordinary prowess of the two kings as they battled one another before their troops. Finally, however, King Obould ran Greneire through with his long sword, but Obould was severely wounded by the time Greneire had breathed his last breath. The orcs erupted into battle once again, and no one is quite certain what became of King Obould.

It was through the smoke and snow that the victors of the conflict emerged: the dwarves of Clan Warcrown along with a contingent of troops from Silverymoon. Charging in through the shattered gates, these new attackers quickly routed the exhausted orcs of the citadel, sending them scurrying off into the wilderness.

King Emerus Warcrown now rules the Citadel of Many Arrows, though the dwarves now call the city by its old name of Felbarr. Most in the North still tend to refer to the city as the Citadel, however, waiting to see if it can withstand the next orc horde. King Warcrown has put out a call for all dwarves to help defend the citadel, and news of a new vein of gold and silver is spreading rapidly through dwarven communities.~

@7312 = ~History of the North—The Might of Men:

Along the coast, in what was once the elven community of Illefarn, humanity was once again rising in power. Merchants from the south, tribesmen from the North, and seafarers from western islands had created a village around a trading post on a deep-water harbor, first known as Nimoar's Hold after the Uthgardt chieftain whose tribe seized and fortified the ramshackle village. Nimoar and his successors, known as War Lords, led the men of Waterdeep (as it had become known to ship captains) in a slowly losing battle against the trolls. In a final, climactic battle, the trolls breached the aging palisade and all seemed lost—until the magic of Ahghairon of Silverymoon turned luck against the trolls, destroying and scattering them.

Ahghairon, heir to the heritage and learning of Netheril, stayed in Waterdeep, and in his 112th year he again saved the city—this time from itself. In so doing, he created the Lords of Waterdeep. The city grew into the greatest in the North, possibly in all Faerûn, With Waterdeep as a firm anchor, civilization forged cautiously into the wilderness. Illuskan (now Luskan) was taken from the orcs. Loudwater, Llorkh, Triboar, Longsaddle, Secomber, and other towns were settled by pioneers from Waterdeep, sponsored by Waterdhavian merchant families.

Though it's been centuries since the last orc invasion, there's still constant strife. Barbarians harass merchants, travelers, and towns; the seas swim with Northmen pirates; and wars have marred the land in recent years. Luskan, now a fierce merchant city known to harbor—and support—pirates, waged a war with the island realm of Ruathym over an act of piracy against one of the few legitimate Luskan merchant ships. The war raged for nearly a year, with Ruathym slowly losing ground. When it appeared Luskan would finally win the naval war and land on the island itself, the Lords' Alliance entered the fray. They threatened war against Luskan if the skirmishes didn't stop immediately. Unable to fight a two-front war efficiently, Luskan canceled its invasion plans.

Tensions between Luskan and Ruathym are still high, and their ships are often seen taking potshots at each other as they pass, often just a wave or two away from each other. The government of Ruathym has recently been sending adventurers into the hills of its island realm, looking for mercenaries who are killing merchants, farmers, and woodsmen. Ruathym believes Luskan still has a presence on the island, trying to win through subversion and terrorism what it could not accomplish through war.

To the far north, the Ten Towns have finished rebuilding after being nearly destroyed by the monstrous forces of Akar Kessel. With help from the tundra barbarians living nearby, they've built and repaired their cities, replanted the sparse foliage, and—most importantly—replenished the morale of their citizens. A recent trader who passed through the area carrying seventeen wagons of rare oak lumber said that it was nearly impossible to determine who's a barbarian and who isn't. "They're living together!" he reported in amazement.~

@7313 = ~History of the North—1368, Year of the Banner:

As the dwarves settled in for the winter in their reclaimed city of Felbarr, a group of Zhentarim-sponsored adventurers broke into Great Worm Cavern, slaying Elrem the Wise, shaman leader of the Great Worm tribe, as the tribe's warriors descended into the ranks of the evil adventurers, teleportation magic spirited at least three of those responsible—as well as a vast amount of treasure stolen from Elrem—to safety.

According to Themrin, the tribe's present shaman, Elrem promised to "watch over the tribe in spirit now that my mortal form is destroyed." Despite the reassuring words of Elrem, the tribe suffered through an oppressive winter that included both heavy snow, scarce game, and low morale.

Trusted visitors to the barbarian encampment report that Themrin and Gweshen "Ironhand" Talistars are wearing some form of armor made from the scales of Elrem. This use of their former shaman's body as "protection" was supposedly ordained through a dream vision. The armor appears as little more than a supple leather armor, but seems to deflect blows and protect as well as full plate mail.

Nesme reported a drastic rise in the number of troll attacks in the Evermoors, and various sources confirm that something is driving the trolls out of the moors. Whatever is behind the trolls' exodus is destined to remain a mystery for the remainder of the year, as adventuring parties expend themselves against the never-ending supply of trolls that are fleeing the bog.

In the most surprising move of the year, the Blue Bear Tribe, led by the shaman/chieftain Tanta Hagara, marched on the fiend-ridden fortress of Hellgate Keep. While a brief struggle for political control of the city was reported by various sources, Tanta Hagara emerged as the new ruler of the city.~

@7314 = ~History of the North—1369, Year of the Gauntlet:

The tumultuous climate of Hellgate Keep continued to provide adventuring activity. A group of Harpers infiltrated the city using cloaking magic and revealed that Tanta Hagara was actually an annis. This revelation did nothing to hamper the Blue Bear's respect for their powerful chieftain however, and the city responded to the unmasking by attacking caravans en route to Sundabar. In addition, a few expeditionary forces of tanar'ri were sent to harass the Citadel of the Mists, Sundabar, and Silverymoon. Tanta Hagara informed her "loyal troops" that gates existed in these cities that could allow other tanar'ri to "join us in the glorious battles to come as we take control of all of the North!"

Alustriel cast powerful magical spells in the defense of Silverymoon against the raiding tanar'ri, and the city itself suffered no damage from their attack. The Mistmaster of the Citadel of the Mists likewise aided in the defense of his citadel, though reports still rage about the assistance of the treants of the High Forest.

Sundabar suffered from Hellgate Keep's attack, as the fiends broke through the walls and raised havoc along the city streets. While adventurers battled the fiends, Helm Dwarfriend led a large contingent of the city guard to drive the remainder from Sundabar. Still, the fiends from Hellgate Keep left the city with the satisfaction of knowing that it was burning in their wake. Within two days, however, the fires were extinguished, and Sundabar has since rebuilt from the attack.

By mid Eleasias, rumors that Turlang, the powerful treant who resides in the northern High Forest, was actively defending the woodlands near the Citadel of the Mists reached the ears of Tanta Hagara, the hag-ruler of Hellgate Keep. News that Turlang was aiding the Mistmaster did not escape her notice, and the belief that the Citadel of the Mists was holding an extraplanar artifact only added to the hag's interest.

Tanta assembled a large force consisting of more than 100 tanar'ri and other fiends as well as 500 members of the Blue Bear tribe to raze the Citadel of the Mists. But as the evil forces marched their way into the High Forest, the Mistmaster put his own plan into motion. Two Harper agents, a bard named Cryshana Fireglen and a priest of Mystra known as Spellviper, infiltrated Hellgate Keep disguised as members of the Blue Bear tribe. Each carried with them part of an extraplanar artifact called the Gatekeeper's Crystal.

The Gatekeeper's Crystal is an artifact shaped like a three-pointed star that is made of onyx and an unknown metal that entwines itself through the gem. Each point of the star is a separate piece that can be combined together to create the artifact or separated to form three powerful magical items. While the crystal can be used in different manners, it was primarily created to bring down wards, including mythals and other powerful protections. According to legend, it was created by a powerful lich who used it to render clerics powerless, stripping them of their ability to turn undead and nullifying necromantic magic within a 50-mile radius.

The Mistmaster had a different use for the Gatekeeper's Crystal, but he needed volunteers to aid him in placing two shards of the crystal at precise locations within the warded city of Hellgate Keep. In particular, he needed two people who would be willing to trade their lives to exterminate the fiends of Hellgate Keep forever. Spellviper and Cryshana agreed to the suicide mission, Holding the pieces of the crystal, the two Harpers waited for the Mistmaster to activate the magic with his third piece, initiating the magic that would tear Hellgate Keep asunder. When a blazing beam of purple energy illuminated the skies over the keep, no one within the fiend's stronghold had time to wonder what was happening.

The power of the Gatekeeper's Crystal forced the wards to cascade upon the city, causing an implosion that shook the ground for more than 100 miles. As quickly as the wards surrounding Hellgate Keep collapsed, the crystal released the magical energy in an explosion that leveled every building in the city, leaving nothing but fist-sized chunks of rocks where Hellgate Keep once stood. Not a living creature stirred in the remains; all was silent and lifeless.

The force of tanar'ri from Hellgate Keep was unsure what had happened but had felt the tremor when the Gatekeeper's Crystal had been activated. They were fighting for their own lives, however, as the treants, korred, centaurs, satyrs, dryads, and other creatures of the High Forest—including defenders of the Citadel of the Mists—battered them into the moist earth. One of the North's most notable rulers fell in the battle, however, but he took at least six tanar'ri with him to his grave. Faurael Blackhammer, the lord protector of Triboar, fell alongside his troops near the conclusion of the conflict.

Within weeks after the final battle with Hellgate Keep, treants blocked passage farther north at the joining of the Heart-blood and Delimbiyr rivers. While the treants care little for hunters and adventurers passing through the area, all caravans seeking passage north to Sundabar have been repulsed—and this is not a matter that the treants wish to negotiate.

In another mishap blamed on Turlang, Turnstone Pass was blocked by a tremendous avalanche. This final calamity sealed the Upvale from any major force of men. Travel into the area formerly occupied by Hellgate Keep is now limited to adventurers and other brave travelers.

The Mistmaster has been questioned repeatedly by some of the most powerful wizards in the realms, including Elminster of Shadowdale and Khelben Arunsun, about the current location of the Gatekeeper's Crystal. Most sources claim that the pieces of the crystal have been scattered amongst the planes again, but no one is certain.

Near Nesme, the source of the trolls' exodus is revealed. Fog and cloud giants have taken up residence in the moor, driving the trolls from the giants' new "homeland." While its unknown how many giants have taken up residence in the High Moor, estimates range up to several hundred. A thick mist continually hangs in the air of the Evermoors now, even more persistent and thick than the mist before the giants' arrival. Many believe that these new mists are the work of the cloud giants, but none can be certain.

Alustriel of Silverymoon sent a detachment of guards to investigate the eastern borders of the moor, and the guards returned with news that a gathering of around 20 fog giants who were "of good nature and quite friendly" had taken up residence in a formerly troll-infested area.

Guards from neighboring Nesme were not so fortunate, however, running into a clan of violent, boulder-hurling fog and cloud giants who nearly decimated their unit. In addition, a group of adventurers crawled into Nesme with terrible burns, reporting that they had run into a black dragon at a fog giant encampment. Overall, it appears that both good and evil giants now call the moor their home.~

@7316 = ~History of the North—1370, Year of the Tankard:

Even before spring has graced the Savage North, reports of treants massing in the High Forest have reached all of the northern cities. It seems that all of the creatures of the forest have mobilized to restore the High Forest after the fall of Hellgate Keep. Something must still reside below the ruins of Hellgate Keep, however, for the Company of the Jaded Heart never emerged from the depths below the city. The treants have since blocked entrance into the ruins, sealing whatever evil still lurks within far below the sight of man.

But there is other activity in the North as well. Luskan still flirts with war, tempting neighboring cities and yet staying just below the wrath of Waterdeep. The barbarians still brew in the north, easy to take offense at innocent incursions into their sacred holdings. Rumors of Zhentarim agents scouring the Fallen Lands for powerful magic from long-lost Netheril continue to circulate. And adventurers still abound in the Savage Frontier.~

@7317 = ~History of Waterdeep:

Waterdeep was used as a trading site for trade activities between northern tribesmen and southern merchants more than two millennia ago. By 1,000 years ago, permanent farms had sprung up in the area. The first mention of a Waterdeep (not as a city, but as a collection of warlords) occurs only 400 years ago. The city was truly established as a going concern by 1032 DR, the year Ahghairon became the first Lord of Waterdeep, and the date from which Northreckoning is counted. The city grew spectacularly, such that by 1248 DR both the City of the Dead and the guilds had been developed. The guildmasters seized control soon afterward, ushering in a period of unrest and bitter conflict known as the Guildwars. The Guildwars ended only when the two surviving guildmasters brought in their own period of misrule. It was only in 1273 DR that the present system of government (or lack thereof was instituted. This was the year that the Magisters were established and the secret Lords of Waterdeep were firmly reestablished. Since that time, the city has continued to grow and prosper. Humankind and other races come from all over the realms to earn hard coin in the City of Splendors. Over the years these successful merchants have set up guilds and themselves become nobility, supporting the secretive Lords of Waterdeep who police the city fairly, yet with a light hand, by means of the superb city guard (soldiers), city watch (police), and over twenty black-robed magistrates. As a result, Waterdeep is a place tolerant of different races, religions, and lifestyles. This in turn has encouraged commerce, and Waterdeep has grown into a huge, eclectic city.~

@7318 = ~History of the Dales and the Elven Court:

The founding of the Dalelands long preceded the creation of any of the existing Dales by hundreds of years, and the year numbering system known as Dalereckoning is actually a commemoration of humankind being given permission to settle in the lands north and west of the Inner Sea. Most of the current Dales are relative newcomers, the older having been abandoned, destroyed, or overrun long ago. In those ancient days, when Suzail and Chondathan (now called Saerloon) were mere coastal trading posts, the elves who ruled this forest entertained a request from settlers from the East; refugees and farmers from far-off Impiltur and Damara. This request was to farm and settle the borders of the great forest Cormanthor, in particular the rich delves and dales along the rivers Arkhen and Ashaba. These newcomers did not wish to lumber or clear the inhabited forest, but only to settle on the rich territories on its edges, and unlike some other settlers (early Sembia comes to mind) were willing to ask permission.

The lords of the Elven Court granted that request in return for aid from these new Dalelanders against outside aggression, both monstrous (orcs and goblins from the lands of Thar) and human (the rising powers in Cormyr and Sembia). In commemoration of this pact, humans and elves raised the Standing Stone that is now seen where the Moonsea Ride reaches Rauthauvyr's Road, the road from Essembra to Hillsfar. It is from the date of the raising of this stone that Dalereckoning is counted. According to the pact made, the Dalesmen would only settle those regions that were unforested or unclaimed by the elves. As the elven woods receded under the axes of further invaders and settlers, old Dales perished and new ones came into being along the borders of the woods. People, both good and bad, have raised petty nations in the Dalelands since, though any one Dale that turned against the pact would have to deal with the others. Each of the Dales is a large swath of farms and fields, with a few scattered settlements and usually one central marketplace, capital, or Dale center. These centers are often, but not always, named after the Dales they are in, adding to the confusion as to what is a Dalelands territory.

The Dales are not city-states, for their largest groupings of population rate as towns at best, and they lack the defensive walls common throughout the Heartlands. They are neither true nations in the fashion of Cormyr or Sembia, and occupy a gray middle ground wherein they are nothing more, or less, than Dales.

Each Dale has slightly different laws, customs, and military organizations. Many rely on the work of charismatic heroes and adventuring companies for aid in times of trouble, and a large number of these individuals use the region as a base. This attraction for adventurers is further increased by the large number of elven and pre-elven ruins in the area and the departure of the Elven Court for Evermeet, leaving the woods open for exploration and exploitation.

The history of the Dales is filled with battles and attacks on its various members. In the Year of the Worm (1356 DR), Scardale, under the command of Lashan Aumersair, launched a number of swift attacks, conquering a number of the surrounding Dales. A coalition of forces from the others, as well as Sembia, Cormyr, and Zhentil Keep crushed the invaders and occupied Scardale. During the Time of Troubles (1358 DR/0 PR), Shadowdale was attacked by Zhentil Keep. More recently, the Dalelands have committed forces to a unified army under King Azoun IV of Cormyr to turn back the Tuigan Invasion (1360 DR).~

@7319 = ~History of Cormyr:

Cormyr dates its years from the founding of House Obarskyr 1,342 years ago, the first of the noble houses and the line of its kings. For the bulk of this time, Cormyr was little more than a single city (Suzail) and a few fortified outposts. At times the monarch was forced by rebellion and intrigue to rule from those outposts instead of from the throne. King Azoun is the fourth of his name and the 71st of his line.

The land has been officially at peace for many years—since Rhigaerd overthrew the last of the border raiders. However, Cormyrean armies have taken part in many actions in nearby regions, recently mustering forces to face Gondegal, the rebel of Arabel, to occupy Tilverton on the marches of the Dalelands, and to lead a crusade against the great Tuigan horde invading from the east. One wit has noted that "Yes, the land is at peace, but the army has to keep busy." In addition to pursuing major actions, Cormyrean patrols often skirmish with bandits on the roads in the north and west, and are at present battling orcs and other creatures north and east of Cormyr in Tilver's Gap and Shadow Gap. Both of these areas are threatened by raiders who will menace Cormyr itself if they ever overrun Tilverton. Cormyr has built a fortress, Castle Crag, to defend the kingdom from attacks from that quarter, and maintains the High Horn to protect against attacks from the West.~

@7320 = ~History of Sembia:

The land of Sembia was settled by humans coming to the Sea of Fallen Stars from the south, and was originally chosen for its stands of huge, high-quality iliyr-wood timber so prized in shipbuilding. However, as the forests were cleared over the years, the treecutters came into increasing conflict with elves that feared the loss of their entire wood. This would undoubtedly have occurred, had not the hastily gathered mercenary troops of the fledgling land been defeated by the elves at Singing Arrows (884 DR). This battle convinced distant Chondath to abandon its holdings in the region and allow the immigrant Sembians to establish their independence (though as little more than a collection of rival city-states, much like the Moonsea or Vast of today). It also set the stage for the appearance of the Raven.

The young country grew strong as farms prospered in the newly cleared lands. Craftsmen arrived from the south to take advantage of this chance to acquire land and wealth, bringing their trades with them. Rauthauvyr the Raven unified the city-states and towns in the face of the continuing "elven menace", and insisted on maintaining a standing army, which he kept in practice by policing Sembia's borders and improving its roads. At this time (913 DR), Sembia became as a true nation.

The Moonsea's (Dragon Sea's) mineral wealth was discovered by humankind at about this time, and pressure began to grow for a trade road through the elven woods to make Sembia the world's gateway to all these riches. The Raven went alone as an envoy to the Elven Court. There, he asked the elders of their council to approve a road, open to humans, linking Sembia to the shores of the Dragon Sea (an earlier road had been destroyed during the conflict and was now overgrown). Raven proposed that the elves choose the route and retain control of it and the woods around it, so that no woodcutting or human settlement would occur. The elves had earlier made similar arrangements with the Dalesmen and had no difficulty with the concept of such an agreement. However, the inhabitants of Velarsdale (now Harrowdale) refused the proposal, not wanting or needing such a road at that time (curious, since later a ruler of Harrowdale commissioned the disastrous Halfaxe Trail). The elves, not wishing to offend long-time allies, refused Raven's request.

Rebuffed, the Raven then threatened to exterminate the isolated elves in Amothoi, the last embattled remnant of the elves in Sembia, if the Elven Court did not cooperate. If the road were built, however, they would be free to trade, or not trade, as they wished. The elves agreed under this pressure, and Sembia's financial future was secured. Hillsfar, on the shores of the Dragon Sea, became a commercial meeting ground between humankind and elves, as did Elventree. The route the elves chose ran past the base of the Standing Stone as a reminder of earlier, less-hostile dealings between humans and elves. Over the years the elves of Amothoi came north to join their brethren or slipped away to seek Evermeet, leaving their wood to gradually disappear.

 Sembia grew rich under merchant leaders of increasing wisdom, such as Saer (for whom Saerb was named) and Selgar (for whom Chancelgaunt was renamed as Selgaunt). Before his death, Rauthauvyr the Raven saw that these merchants had a strong standing council of merchant elders to advise them and to ensure that no ruler could hold onto power by force of arms. Then this farsighted man, creator of a nation, now half-blind and infirm from old war wounds, rode north into the elven woods and disappeared. None know what happened to him or where his bones lie, save perhaps some few elder elves.~

@7321 = ~History of the Moonsea:

The Moonsea has a long history as the border between the elven lands to the south and the darker, more sinister lands of the Ride and Thar, home of dragons and giant and ogre tribes in great multitudes. The deep sea was an excellent barrier to the raiders, as those tribes who sought invasion had to detour around and through the lands that would eventually hold Yulash, Zhentil Keep, and Hillsfar.

The first true settlement in Moonsea was Northkeep, a shining citadel established as a beacon of civilization and a jumping-off point for merchants seeking trade with the dwarves of the North—including not only Tethyamar, but the clans of the Cold Lands—who traded their metalwork and craft for much-needed magic. In the end, Northkeep was sunk beneath the icy waters of the Moonsea by the inhuman forces, and humankind suffered one of many setbacks in the region.

So has been the nature of human habitation of this region since the beginning. Human settlements thrive for a few years, usually through sheer willpower and on the strength of a sharp sword, and then are overrun by goblins, orcs, dragons, beholders, or giants. Phlan has fallen and risen again. Yulash is a ruin where a decade ago there was a thriving town. Hulburg and Sulasspryn are empty hulks. Each of the cities of the Moonsea seems threatened with extinction in its turn, then is rebuilt.

This cycle may be the reason that only the strongest and the most savage survive, even prosper, in the lands of the Moonsea. The greatest cities—Hillsfar, Mulmaster, and the impenetrable Zhentil Keep—are all ruled by evil people who control their lands with iron grips. The lesser cities, Elventree, Phlan, and Thentia, may be less evil, but have a strong, independent, almost chaotic nature. In many ways the Moonsea is a frontier, with a frontier mentality.~

@7322 = ~History of the Vast:

Two millennia ago the Vast was Vastar, the orcish lands. These were the breeding grounds of the goblin hordes that would spill eastward and cross the Dragon Reach in ramshackle boats to raid the elves. The orcs were overthrown by invading dwarves, who established the Realm of the Glimmering Swords. It was during this time that the first humans came to the Vast, including the mage Maskyr.

The rule of the dwarves occurred against a backdrop of constant war with the orcs, such that there were perhaps only 40 years of true peace for the Realm of the Glimmering Swords. The orcs overran the dwarves, and they escaped extinction only through the aid of human and elven allies. The remaining dwarves left the region to the newly arriving humans and retreated to the east, to the south, and to isolated and hidden communities within the Vast.

The most successful of the humans were the adventurers whose hunger was sated by gold and whose thirst was slaked by great deeds. This was the Time of the Glorious Fools, and there are those who will argue that it is still that age, as adventurers still rule the cities of Calaunt and Ravens Bluff. The orcs today are contained, if not conquered, and trade has grown up in the lands of the Vast. However, for many individuals with adventuring blood, it is still a wilderness in which one may prove one's worth.~

@7324 = ~History of the Western Heartlands:

The history of the Western Heartlands is a history of endless battles and destroyed empires. In ancient times, these were the lands of the Fallen Kingdom of Illefarn, the Lost Kingdom of Man, and rumored Netheril. In more recent history, the land has been fertilized with blood and bone as forces from the Empires of the Sands surged northward, the evil peoples within Dragonspear and the Goblin Marches spilled forth, and mercenary companies moved to and fro in the service of one petty warlord after another. Recent battles leveled the Way Inn and threatened Daggerford. Even the Time of Troubles did not leave this desolate land unmarked—Bhaal himself perished at Boareskyr Bridge, and the waters it passes over have remained poisoned to this day.

The cities of the Western Heartlands are strong, independent, and varied. They are also strongly motivated by trade and listen harder to the ringing of gold than the call of battle. But something else prospers in the open land—freedom and opportunity. No nation lays claim on the Western Heartlands to land beyond that which their armies can control, and no warlord can make demands beyond the swing of his axe. Small holds and castles regularly spring up, only to be knocked down by invading forces or abandoned after a generation or two. Lost dungeons and secret citadels lie scattered throughout the land, and this rugged frontier presents more than enough opportunities for adventurers.~

@7325 = ~History of the Zhentarim, Two Zhents' Worth:

Much confusion exists in the realms regarding Zhentil Keep and the (not-so) secret society known as the Black Network or Zhentarim. The two are closely tied, such that a speaker may refer to one when meaning the other and still be clearly understood. In general, both mean trouble.

Zhentil Keep is a walled independent city on the western shores of the Moonsea. It is one of the most evil cities in the realms, a blight on the North, and a haven for Evil groups, plotting manipulators, dark religions, and foul practices. Its rulers seek to dominate the lands around it, including the Dragonspine Mountains, Yulash, Voonlar, and the neighboring Dales. The city of Zhentil Keep and its armies (known as the Zhentilar, to make matters more confusing) have destroyed Teshendale, come close to destroying Daggerdale, and for a long time had an agent ruling Shadowdale.

The Zhentarim is an organization of evil priests, wizards, and inhuman creatures bent on controlling all the trade and power between the Sword Coast (meaning Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep) and the Moonsea (including the intervening lands of Cormyr and Anauroch). Its aims in the Moonsea area are the same as Zhentil Keep's, and the two factions work hand-in-glove, often sharing the same membership. The Zhentarim have a more far-reaching effect than Zhentil Keep, though, and have agents throughout the North.

In addition, the Zhentarim are not limited to Zhentil Keep itself, and maintain a number of fortified outposts. Their rulership has spread with the passing years. In addition to being the dominant force in Zhentil Keep, the Zhentarim control the Citadel of the Raven and Darkhold, two important castle complexes. Over the years, more power has been moving away from Zhentil Keep (filled with a lot of unknown and untrustworthy flunkies) and into these more secure areas.

Within the Dalelands area, Zhentarim smells of Zhentil Keep and vice versa, but in reality not every Keeper (yet another name for a native of Zhentil Keep) is of the Black Network, and not every agent of the Zhentarim is from Zhentil Keep. Adventurers should watch who they trust as a result.~

@7326 = ~History of Ulgarth:

Ulgarth was settled by the great empire of Raurin, in the height of its power. When the empire was destroyed, it endured centuries of barbarism. Warchiefs united the country several times during this period. They fought many skirmishes with other barbarians, particularly those in Durpar and Var the Golden. In 202 DR, the barbarian tribes were nearly wiped out by the forces of Mulhorand.

In 348 DR, a group of outlaws, fleeing the justice of the priest-kings of Mulhorand, came to Ulgarth. There they found a fertile, almost unoccupied land. They settled down, and began raising children and crops. This new society in Ulgarth gradually grew in power, while its neighbors grew apace. But while Durpar grew as a result of its commerce and its philosophy of balance, Ulgarth concentrated on agrarian pursuits. The Ulgarthians developed a highly structured caste system of lords and peasants. In 1002 DR, the centuries long skirmishes between Durpar and Ulgarth came to an end, as the two countries finally reached a balance of power. There were too many centuries of warfare between the countries for them to completely trust each other. With their mutual border well defended on both sides, both countries have given up on the idea of conquering the other.

Trade between the Ulgarth and the Shining Lands has become a vital factor to both nations. Ulgarth produces many of the items that Durparians trade throughout the world. In return, Durpar trades many exotic items to Ulgarth. Of course, the Durparian merchants usually get the better of any trade. The current king, Drasna the Fortunate, has continued on his predecessor's policy of non-aggression with the Durparians.~

@7327 = ~History of the Drow, The Descent:

We know very little of the Ilythiiri, or "elves of the South," before this crucial event. Even then they were known as "dark elves," for the hue of their skins. They dwelt in the jungles and hot forests of the South. A proud, warlike, culturally advanced (some sages of other elven peoples say "decadent") folk, the Ilythiiri attacked all neighbors, including other elven tribes. Their cruel raids and depredations, ordered by warlike nobility and the clergy of their two cruel deities, Ghaunadaur and Lolth, forced elves, humans, dwarves, and others to ally against them.

Defeated in a series of titanic magical battles, the dark elves fled into underground warrens they had earlier discovered. This event, known as "the Descent," marked the end of the drow as a surface-dwelling race.~

// [automatic scan] Issues: 1  | Surplus trailing whitespace at line 1
@7328 = ~History of the Drow, The Dark Wars:

The warlike drow nature did not change when they escaped their surface foes during the Descent. In fact, they immediately launched a series of wars to establish territories in the Underdark. They began by stealing and seizing dwarven magical items and using them against the dwarves—establishing an enmity that is still strong today.

The drow then fought among themselves, noble against noble, priest against priestess, for rule of their new realm. This all-out war ended amid great magical explosions that brought down the roof of the largest dwarven cavern they had seized, great Bhaerynden. The ceiling collapsed entirely, burying many drow and the shattered dwarven cities. The cavern, now open to the sky, became known as the Great Rift. The surviving drow nobles gathered what people, slaves, and equipment they could seize and fled into the Underdark in search of places to dwell. "The Scattering" brought about the many rival, self-interested cities where most drow live today.~

@7329 = ~History of Waterdeep—Age 0, Trademoots and Pioneers:

Few now know the true history of this great city, which had its beginnings over a thousand years ago, when the North was truly what Southerners still sneeringly call it: "the Savage North." In those days, most of the North was covered with vast, tall forests of ancient green, and inhabited by dwarves and goblinkind (in the most northern mountains and foothills) and elves (in widely scattered forest enclaves everywhere else). A few primitive human tribes lived along the Sword Coast, fishing and hunting and gathering in spring and fall to trade their furs for the merchants' jewelry and metal tools, or the occasionally available weapon or two, with vessels sailing in from the South. In the spring, these vessels came primarily to cut and take huge trees for shipbuilding, trees being no longer available in such large sizes farther south.

In the fall, the vessels came in to cut timber for their own repairs, or to take on a cargo of wood if the misfortunes of trading had left their holds low or empty. Most of these trademoots were at a certain place where there was a great natural deep-water harbor, protected from the sea by a rocky spur of land, an arm of an isolated coastal crag, and a rocky island beyond it.~

@7330 = ~History of Waterdeep—Age I, The Rise of the Warlords:

Over the years, the forest was cut back farther and farther from the shore, and tribes began to stay most of the year there, farming the cleared land. The wiser among them claimed and controlled some of the timber in order to trade for more weaponry and tools. Such claims angered many who found the squatters rich from frequent trade, and brought attacks from land and sea, the more warlike tribes slaughtering the more sedentary settlers. Noted among these tribes was that led by Nimoar, a chieftain who ordered his people to seize the farms, crude wooden docks, trading sheds, and storage barns built up around the bay. They settled there themselves, and erected a log palisade within an earthen embankment to protect the holdings, After several abortive pirate and tribal raids, Nimoar's people thrived in their new home, a fledgling town referred to as "the town of Water-deep."

Farther north, orc tribes had outgrown their mountain strongholds. Attempts to expand underground met with fierce dwarven resistance (although many small gnomish colonies were overwhelmed and wiped out), and the orcs spread out on the surface of the land, coming south and down out of the mountains, hurling their seemingly endless numbers against all who stood in their path. Here and there elven enclaves held out, but the push southward displaced many other northern inhabitants, including the "everlasting ones" (trolls), who came down into the newly-cleared lands northeast of Nimoar's Hold, those lands now known as the Trollmoors. Nimoar died of old age during this time of increasing danger. Younger War Lords led the men of Waterdeep (for so the ship-captains called the harbor) in battles against the trolls. There were many bloody struggles between men and trolls for a decade, until the magic of a Northern youth named Ahghairon turned the fortunes of war against the trolls, and the "everlasting ones" were destroyed or scattered. Ahghairon rose slowly in skill and power with the passage of years, until he became a great mage. He discovered a supply of potions of longevity (or learned the art of making such), for he lived on, still physically a man in his prime, for decade upon decade.

Fearing further attacks, the men of Waterdeep raised a small keep on the slopes of Mount Waterdeep above their farms, where fire arrows from on high could defend against attacking trolls. Many outlying tribes who had come to the settlement for safety from the trolls stayed, and expanded the walls with new farms several times. War Lords ruled the Free City of Waterdeep, holding it independent and increasingly wealthy as years passed.~

@7331 = ~History of Waterdeep— Age III, The Bloody Reign of the Guildmasters:

There was great turmoil in the City as the Guildmasters argued amongst themselves as to who should govern the City, and more than one merchant of power was found murdered. Groups of liveried bodyguards appeared openly armed on the streets, accompanying their masters, and two very troubled months passed as they bickered and parleyed (and occasionally dueled in the streets). At last, they decided that all Masters should rule Waterdeep together, in a council. The lesser nobles and many townsfolk protested, saying that the Lords ruled by right and by the peoples' consent, but the Guildmasters said that the Lords had not been seen since Ahghairon's death, and that they must always have been golems or zombies controlled by Ahghairon himself, to conceal his lone rule, and indeed, the Lords were silent and unseen, and continued to be so.

In truth, the Lords were real men and women whose identities had been compromised, over the years, by certain curious Guildmasters who had ordered them slain by their own closemouthed, loyal servants following Ahghairon's death. The only Lords still surviving (those who had remained secret) were Baeron, a woodworker, and Shilam, an apprentice wizard. These surviving Lords kept very quiet, and waited. The Guildmasters thought all the living Lords of the City had been eliminated, and took firm rule over Waterdeep.

The Guildmasters ruled Waterdeep for only six years ere their self-interested squabbling led to bloodshed. Open quarrels and a few murders quickly erupted into a brief but vicious series of street fights and midnight attacks. This strife, ofttimes termed "the Guildwars" by sages (although it was never as long-drawn-out or so formal as to be called a "war" when it was taking place), left all but two Guildmasters dead, most of the City's best minds stilled, and much of the City's gold wasted or plundered with the Guilds in disarray.

The surviving Guildmasters were Lhorar Gildeggh of the Shipwrights and Ehlemm Zoar of the Gemcutters. These two—ruthless manipulators both—were well-matched and could not overcome each other, though their private armies clashed often in the streets. At length, they sickened of bloodshed, after many from both families were dead in the gutters, and agreed to rule together. Two thrones were set up in Castle Waterdeep, and from then the two argued bitterly over this and that, and the City was a place of tension and fear. All matters, including the recognition of new Guildmasters to rule the "headless" guilds, had to come before the Two Lords Magister, as Lhorar and Ehlemm were called. Few matters were settled.~

@7332 = ~History of Waterdeep—Age II, The Lords' Rule Begins:

In his 112th winter, Ahghairon had a sharp disagreement with Raurlor, who was then Warlord of Waterdeep. Raurlor wanted to use Waterdeep's acquired wealth and strength-of-arms to create a Northern empire, with Waterdeep its capital (and Raurlor its ruler), and gathered armies for the purpose. Ahghairon defied him before all the people, and Raurlor ordered the mage be chained. Ahghairon magically struck aside all who sought to lay hands on him. In a fury Raurlor struck at the mage with his own blade. Ahghairon rose into the air, just out of reach, and, as the infuriated Warlord slashed repeatedly at his rising feet, gestured. Raurlor's blade transmuted in his hand, from steel into a hissing serpent, which promptly bit him. The Warlord died of the venom before the shocked people assembled there. Ahghairon then gathered all the captains of Waterdeep's army, and all the seniors of the families of Waterdeep. While runners sought to bring them to the Castle, flames roared and crackled in the Warlord's empty chair-of-state at Ahghairon's bidding, so that no one sat there. Then at a gesture from the mage, the flames were gone as though they had never been, leaving the chair unmarked. Ahghairon seated himself, then, and proclaimed himself the first Lord of Waterdeep, saying that henceforth wisdom and not armed might would rule in the city. He would gather some few—in secret—to rule as Lords with him, masked and disguised when they appeared to the people, but equal to him in authority and free of coercion by any, himself included. These Lords were to be drawn from all walks of life in the city, and could serve as long as they wished.

The people heard, and agreed, and for the next two hundred years, Ahghairon ruled Waterdeep with his unknown fellow Lords, Over the years, the masked Lords were a group of sometimes five, six, or seven, who appeared seldom and said little. Some whispered that they were Ahghairon's servants, or even magical automatons controlled by the Old Mage. Still, Ahghairon's justice was swift and fair, his laws good, his guardsmen polite and just as ready to help as apprehend, and the people approved. The years passed in peace and prosperity. The North was opened to humans. Roads built under Ahghairon's direction linked it together, from the ruins of "the Fallen Kingdom," which had been shattered by goblin races' attacks before men were numerous in the North, to the cities that would later become Amn. Waterdeep grew fivefold in size and wealth. From all over the realms, folk began to come to the "Crown of the North," drawn by money—and among them came those who rob, cheat, and steal. When word of doings extending beyond simple theft to deception-in-workmanship and the appearance of many fly-by-night impostor craftsmen reached Ahghairon's ears, he called together the senior merchants, "the Noble Ones," and suggested that they form guilds as was done in the far South to police the unscrupulous of their own professions. Some resisted, or were furious, but most saw the advantages of such an arrangement, particularly if they were free to set matters up themselves, and not have less favorable arrangements forced upon them. The Guilds were created forthwith, Waterdeep continued to grow in size and prosperity, Twice more the city walls were expanded, and its merchants traveled the world over, bringing back exotic goods from afar, and spreading word of the city's wealth to remote lands. In the South, some listened with an eye to conquest or at least plunder, but swords were already out in those southern lands in a time of widespread strife, and no invaders came.

Ahghairon's health eventually failed and he died. He was buried with ceremony in his tower, which was secured against thieves and fools. Those who learned the arts arcane from the Old Mage cast the most potent protective magics known upon his home and resting-place (which, many believe, remains inviolate today).~

@7333 = ~History of Waterdeep—Age lV, The Return of the Lords:

One day to the Courts of the Lord Magister came two people masked and robed as the Lords of Waterdeep of old. Where they came from no one knew, but they appeared in the Castle's Great Hall where the Courts were, and commanded the Lords Magister to leave the city forthwith. Laughing, the Lords Magister refused, whereupon the shorter of the masked intruders (the lady Shilam, apprentice to Ahghairon and his undeclared heir as first Lord of the City) blasted them with lightning and fire, and their very thrones were shattered and toppled.

The taller of the two intruders (Baeron) then called for the heads of the noble houses to come to them, or leave the city forthwith and forever, if they cared not to come by nightfall. All in the Courts heard, and the news was cried in the streets.

The surviving nobles came, reluctantly and with bodyguards, expecting such a summons to be a trap. Baeron spoke to them and the crowd of curious townsfolk that had also come, saying, "this must not happen again." If Waterdeep was to be safe once more, he told them, all must support what he and his fellow Lord now planned, as they had supported Ahghairon in the past. The two would choose others to be Lords as before, he said, and they would rule in secret, as before—save for himself. He removed his mask, and said, "I am Baeron. I would be Lord as Ahghairon was before. I would be safe in this my city again." And the folk of Waterdeep there agreed. Shilarn, still masked, commanded that the houses of the Two Lords Magister be Outcast. There was protest, and she raised her hands that had blasted the thrones, and it was still again. And the house of Gildeggh and of Zoar were outcast.

Peace returned to the city, and Waterdhavians to their labors. To inhibit discovery of who the Lords were, Baeron selected certain men of character whom he knew well, and appointed them Magisters ("Black Robes," they were soon called, from their robes of office) under the Lords, to judge and apply the laws of Waterdeep in daily affairs. These Magisters he paid well, to raise them from temptation, and gave lodgings to those who feared for safety to dwell among the people. To so serve, he told the city, was a burden, not a proud misuse of authority, and if any wished to no longer serve, or were found wanting, they were not to be vilified, but accorded respect. And over the Magisters the Lords sat in their Court, to correct and overrule the judgments of the Magisters. Baeron told the people that none were to decry or belittle any judgments of Magisters that the Lord saw fit to alter or cast aside. If any thought ill of the offices or those who held them they could turn back to the rule of sword and whim, and perish as had those before them. Before the Lord's Court Baeron encouraged people to speak freely for the length of a short candle's burning, without fear of chastisement or reproach from the Lords for anything said, as long as they spoke openly and answered questions or opposing views put to them by any there. Thus, he held, just grievances of folk would be heard, no matter how small the matter or lowly the speaker. And so it was. Slow to take hold, until people knew it for careful justice, but enduring beyond Baeron's time, and beyond Shilarn's time, and beyond the time of their daughter Lhestyn "The Masked Lady," who wed Zelphar Arunsun of Neverwinter, and was mother to Khelben "Blackstaff' Arunsun, a Lord of Waterdeep today, who knows the secrets of long years as Ahghairon did. And as the years have passed, Waterdeep has grown in size and variety, flourishing with good trade under the tolerance and protection of strong defenders and good government. The years passed not without troubles, varying from the Godswar (when Waterdeep played host to gods dying and ascending) to such occurrences as a green dragon assailing the Field of Triumph (part of a plot by the Knights of the Shield to overthrow the Lords' Rule), but the city and her peoples survived and prevailed against all strife. The Lords' Alliance provides continued safety for all the settlements of the northern Sword Coast and those inland, with Waterdeep as the heart of the alliance. Though it can be matched in size or commerce, there is no city the realms over that compares to the sheer variety of life and experiences found in fair Waterdeep, Crown of the North.~

@7334 = ~History of the Unicorn Run:

Bards and sages pass down the tale that the headwaters of the Unicorn Run are, in truth, the Font of Life and a cradle of fecundity. Each natural race is said to have emerged from the womb of Chauntea onto Toril at the river's source and then traveled down the Unicorn Run to the outside world. Some say that a daughter of Chauntea resides at the river's source to usher the newborns into the world, while others claim that Shialla midwifes the process.

Regardless of the truth, the elves, korreds, and halflings all agree that the Unicorn Run is sacred to life and a site of incredible purity. As a result, all three races have strong taboos about extended trips up the run, for if the river is ever fouled, then no new races will ever be born on Toril again.~

@7336 = ~History of the Last March of the Giants:

East of the Great Rift in the Eastern Shaar once stood a land of the titans. This empire rose at the dawn of time in Faerûn, and its lords thought to challenge the gods in their arrogance. In punishment, the powers cursed the reigning monarch of the land with fascination and his brethren with devotion. The powers then dropped a star onto the land. The impact of the fallen star created a huge valley later known as the Sea of Fallen Stars. Slowly picking up speed, the gall rolled through the titan nation and onward to the south.

Unable to contain his curiosity, the titan king ran off after the bouncing sphere and his devoted followers dutifully followed his tracks. The meteorite rolled on and on until it reached the Great Sea and vanished into the depths. The monarch dove into the sea, and, lemminglike, the entire titan race dove in after him, never to be seen again.

Ashamed at the destruction they had wrought, the powers vowed to keep both curiosity and loyalty firmly in check to avoid such disasters in the future. They have done so to this day, preventing both new ideas from being pursued with any speed and the intelligent races of Toril from ever fully cooperating.~

A paradise unequaled on this world or in the planes, this playground of the gods is not meant for mortals. Any mortal who reaches the Valley becomes a deity, for only deities may exist in the Valley. Far too many mortals with delusions of grandeur have thrown away the pleasures of this side of the Spine and their kingdoms in this world, only to break their backs searching for the legendary Valley of the Gods.~

@7343 = ~The tale of this weapon lost its significance in the sea of great stories that are told about the High Forest, but some bards still sing the song of the skilled archer Adaniss Rhyte.

"Oh, shocked from the strike of his powerful bow,
The slain game sought by Adaniss falls.
Long ago in the time of the Quiet Earth,
The hunt from the famed High Forest calls.

"The Duke of Everlund known for his boast
Of the trophies held in his pride as dear.
Intensely enraged at his rival hunter
Whose bounty by far surpassed his one year.

"One morn tragedy befell the land
With the misconceived death of the Duke's prized hound.
Fallen at the base of a great elm tree
A bow's shot death in its heart was found.

"With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

"The same eve Adaniss called on the Duke,
His solemn mistake he wished to repay.
But the noble's rage claimed ten pounds of flesh
And an archer's arm hit the ground that day.

"The evil lord demanded justice unjust
The most vile curse on his arm to be cast.
Vengeance he sought for the price he had paid
Rhyte vowed the hound's arrow not to be his last.

"In sorrow the town helped him forge an axe
Blessed to honor his most glorious day.
With the mark of Rhyte's arrow to guide its strike
And reputed to kill in the very same way.

"With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

"Again called the forest with its precious game,
And a prize Adaniss with thrill did he seek.
But none could be finer than the great clawed falcon
Sought by all amidst the forest's Lost Peaks.

"Once more the rivalry of the Duke did stir,
For he thought of his skills with Rhyte's bow to be best.
And set his sights on the glorious bird
To emerge as the holder of its sainted crest.

"The two climbed the peaks and searched days on end,
Each of their wills set as strong as the stone.
They found each other at a cliff by chance;
Both of their hatreds ran as deep as the bone.

"With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

"The Duke drew the bow and pulled the string taut,
But first flew Adaniss's axe with its blow.
Cleaved, the lord stumbled to cliff's edge and off,
Defeated by Rhyte's last arrow...

"With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte."

With the help of powerful forest animals, Hannable slew entire bands of orcs before any more damage was inflicted upon the wood.

When the spell is cast, it confers complete invulnerability to all magical weapons. This includes weapons that are blessed or enchanted. The attacks of powerful monsters are also considered magical weapons. This spell cannot be cast on anyone who is protected from normal weapons as well as anyone protected by Mantle, Improved Mantle, or Absolute Immunity. Due to the nature of this spell, with the short casting time and duration, it is mainly used to buy the wizard a few rounds in the thick of combat.

This spell is incredibly powerful, yet has a very short duration, and this, combined with its very short casting time, makes Improved Mantle useful only in the thick of intense combat. This spell will not work in conjunction with Protection From Magical Weapons. This effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~

However, the casting time is also very short, making this spell incredibly useful in the thick of combat, where buying a few seconds can mean the difference between life or death.

By means of a Ray of Enfeeblement, a wizard weakens an opponent, reducing its Strength and thereby the attacks that rely upon it. The victim is reduced to a Strength of 5 for the duration of the spell unless a Save vs. Spell is made. This spell does not affect combat bonuses due to magical items, and those conferring increased Strength function normally. However the target receives all of the penalties for a 5 Strength such as attack and damage penalties as well as lower weight allowance.~

@7808 = ~Tenser's Transformation
(Alteration)

Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Tenser's Transformation is a sight guaranteed to astound any creature not aware of its power, for when the wizard casts the spell, <PRO_HESHE> undergoes a startling transformation. The size and strength of the wizard increase to heroic proportions, and <PRO_HESHE> becomes a formidable fighting machine.

The spell causes the caster to become a berserk Fighter: <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points double, and all damage <PRO_HESHE> sustains is first detracted from this magically-gained life; <PRO_HISHER> Armor Class gains a +4 bonus up to a maximum Armor Class of -10; and all <PRO_HISHER> attacks are made as though <PRO_HESHE> were a Fighter of the same level (i.e. the wizard uses the combat values normally reserved to Fighters, although no extra attacks per round are gained). Each attack also receives a +2 bonus to hit and damage rolls. The effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~

@7852 = ~Black Blade of Disaster
(Evocation)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 18 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to create a black, blade-shaped planar rift about three feet long. It jumps into the caster's hand and is used as a normal sword, remaining there for the duration of the spell. The caster is considered to be proficient to the point of Grand Mastery in this weapon. The sword acts as a +5 weapon and deals 2-24 damage to its victims. Also, every time it hits a target, the victim must make a Save vs. Death at +4 or be disintegrated. There is also a 10% chance with every hit that the sword drains 4 levels from the target and heals the wielder 20 Hit Points.~

(Abjuration)

Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This powerful abjuration spell causes any spells cast against the wizard to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 10 spell levels. This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the wizard, as well as area effects that are stationary, such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud. As long as the spell is cast directly at the wizard it will be absorbed. Something to note is that as long as there are levels remaining, then the spell will be absorbed. For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the wizard, the spell will be absorbed while canceling the spell deflection. It is not affected by a Dispel Magic.~

@10985 = ~Confusion
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 7
Sphere: Chaos
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell causes confusion in one or more enemy creatures within the area, creating indecision and the inability to take effective action. All enemy creatures within the area of effect are allowed Saving Throws vs. Spell with a -2 penalty. Those successfully saving are unaffected by the spell. Those who fail their Saving Throws will either go berserk, stand confused, or wander about for the duration of the spell.

The spell lasts for 1 round for every two levels of the caster. Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible according to their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature.~

This powerful spell enables the priest to imbue one creature with the ability to regenerate. This regeneration will heal any wounds and even regenerate lost limbs. The creature affected will regain 3 Hit Points per second. The effect lasts for 1 round per 2 levels of the caster or until dispelled.

This spell is the reverse of Cure Serious Wounds. Instead of healing the creature touched, it causes damage. On a successful touch from the priest, the spell inflicts 17 points of damage upon the target. The next attack that the priest makes will inflict this effect, however, <PRO_HESHE> only has 2 rounds to make the attack before the spell fizzles.

(Alteration, Illusion)

Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: 2 rounds/level

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the wizard and all of <PRO_HISHER> gear become insubstantial. The caster is subject only to magical or special attacks, including those by weapons of +1 or better enchantment, or by creatures otherwise able to affect those struck only by magical weapons. The wizard also gains 25% resistance to magic damage. While in wraithform, the caster cannot cast either arcane or divine spells.~

@12145 = ~Remove Magic
(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This is the combat version of Dispel Magic; it will only affect opponents. A Remove Magic dispels the magical effects upon any enemies within the area. This includes effects given from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Remove Magic is above the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Remove Magic is below the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly, if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.

Note: While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect.~

Level: 3

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

By casting this spell, the wizard makes the creature touched undetectable by divination spells such as Clairaudience, Clairvoyance, Locate Object, ESP, and detect spells including Invisibility Purge. It also prevents location by such magical items as crystal balls and ESP medallions. It does not affect the Know Alignment spell.~

By means of this spell, the wizard bestows total invulnerability to non-magical hurled and launched missiles such as arrows, bolts, bullets, darts, throwing axes, and throwing daggers. Note, however, that this spell does not convey any protection from such magical attacks as Fireball, Lightning Bolt, or Magic Missile, nor does it protect against magical missiles such as arrows +1.~

By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical field of force that serves as if it were field plate armor (AC 2). It is cumulative with Dexterity bonuses to Armor Class and, in the case of Fighter/Mages, with the shield's bonus. The Ghost Armor spell does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, nor does it prevent spellcasting. It lasts until successfully dispelled or until the duration expires.~

With the casting of this spell, the wizard summons a random selection of 3-HD monsters. There is a 60% chance of receiving one monster and a 40% chance of receiving two monsters. The monster(s) appear within spell range and attack the spellcaster's opponents until the spell duration expires or until they are slain.~

Level: 2
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: Instant

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

A Know Alignment spell enables the Mage to exactly read the aura of a creature. If the creature rolls a successful Saving Throw vs. Spell, the caster learns nothing about that particular creature from the casting. When a character is hit by this spell, he will glow red if evil, green if good, and white if neutral. Certain magical devices negate the power of the Know Alignment spell.~

@12165 = ~Charm Person
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell to negate the effect.

If the spell's recipient fails his Saving Throw (with a +3 modifier), he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give him orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harms—or attempts to harm—the charmed person by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed person, the Charm spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where he is charmed.~

(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 3
Range: 60 ft.
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell works in the exact same manner as Charm Person, with one difference: There is no Saving Throw bonus. Dire Charm affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell to negate the effect.

If the spell's recipient fails <PRO_HISHER> Saving Throw, <PRO_HESHE> regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give <PRO_HIMHER> orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harms—or attempts to harm—the charmed person by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed person, the Dire Charm spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while <PRO_HESHE> was charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where <PRO_HESHE> is charmed.~

(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 1
Range: 0
Duration: 1d4 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

A Friends spell causes the wizard to temporarily gain 6 points of Charisma. Those who view the caster tend to be very impressed with <PRO_HIMHER> and make an effort to be <PRO_HISHER> friends and help <PRO_HIMHER>, as appropriate to the situation. Officious bureaucrats might decide to become helpful; surly gate guards might wax informative; attacking orcs might spare the caster's life, taking <PRO_HIMHER> captive instead.~

(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 3
Range: 35 ft.
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature and any enemy within 4 ft.
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell holds 1d4 humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile and in place for five or more rounds. The Hold Person spell affects any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of mansize or smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be held, while an ogre could not. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every enemy within 4 ft. of the target is also affected. Those who save vs. Spell at -1 are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.

Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

(Enchantment/Charm)

Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

When a wizard casts a Sleep spell, <PRO_HESHE> causes a comatose slumber to come upon one or more enemies (other than undead and certain other creatures specifically excluded from the spell's effects). All creatures to be affected by the Sleep spell must be within a 15-ft. radius. Creatures in the area of effect must make a Saving Throw vs. Death with a -3 penalty or fall asleep. Monsters with 5 Hit Dice or more are unaffected. Attacks against sleeping opponents never miss.~

@12174 = ~Chromatic Orb

Level: 1
Range: 90 ft.
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes a 2-ft. diameter sphere to appear in the caster's hand. When thrown, the sphere heads unerringly to its target. The effect the orb has upon the target varies with the level of the caster. Each orb will do damage to the target against which there is no save and an effect against which the target must save vs. Spell with a +6 bonus:
 1st Level: 1d4 damage and blinds the target for 1 round.
 2nd Level: 1d4 damage and inflicts pain (-1 penalty to Strength, Dexterity, AC, and THAC0) upon the victim.
 3rd Level: 1d6 damage and burns the victim for an additional 1d8 damage.
 4th Level: 1d6 damage and blinds the target for 1 turn.
 5th Level: 1d8 damage and stuns the target for 3 rounds.
 6th Level: 1d8 damage and causes weakness (-4 penalty to THAC0) in the victim.
 7th Level: 1d10 damage and paralyzes the victim for 2 turns.
 10th Level: 1d12 acid damage and turns the victim to stone.
 12th Level: 2d8 acid damage and instantly kills the victim.

NOTE: The victim saves vs. Spell with a +6 bonus against all the effects and gets no save against the damage.~

(Evocation)

Level: 3
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

A Fireball is an explosive burst of flame, which detonates with a low roar and delivers damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it—1d6 points of damage for each level of experience of the caster (up to a maximum of 10d6). The wizard points <PRO_HISHER> finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the Fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation). Creatures failing their Saving Throws each suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful Saving Throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half.~

When this spell is cast, great hail stones pound down for four rounds in a 30-ft. diameter area and inflict 2d8 points of cold damage to any creatures within the area of effect. Also, anyone that remains within the area of effect takes 2d8 cold damage each round for 4 rounds.~

(Evocation)

Level: 3
Range: 70 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Path of bolt
Saving Throw: 1/2

Upon casting this spell, the wizard releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy that inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster (maximum damage of 10d6) to each creature within its area of effect. A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell reduces this damage to half (round fractions down). If the lightning bolt intersects with a wall, it will bounce until it reaches its full length.~

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Use of the Magic Missile spell, one of the most popular 1st-level spells, creates up to five missiles of magical energy that dart forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerringly strike their target, which must be a creature of some sort. Each missile inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage. For every 2 extra levels of experience, the wizard gains an additional missile—<PRO_HESHE> has 2 at 3rd level, 3 at 5th level, 4 at 7th level, up to a total of 5 at 9th level.~

(Necromancy)

Level: 1
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the wizard drains the life force from a target and adds it to <PRO_HISHER> own. The target creature suffers 4 damage, while the Mage gains 4 Hit Points. If the Mage goes over <PRO_HISHER> maximum Hit Point total with this spell, <PRO_HESHE> loses any extra Hit Points after 1 turn.~

@12190 = ~Vampiric Touch
(Necromancy)

Level: 3
Range: Touch
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the target loses 1d6 Hit Points for every 2 caster levels, to a maximum drain of 6d6 for a 12th-level caster. These Hit Points are added to the caster's current Hit Points, with any Hit Points over the caster's normal maximum treated as temporary additional Hit Points. The temporary Hit Points last for 1 hour.

Note: This spell may not be cast multiple times to radically increase the caster's maximum Hit Points.~

@12197 = ~Strength
(Alteration)

Level: 2
Range: 20 ft.
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Application of this spell sets the Strength of the character to 18 and then adds a +50% bonus on top of this. The character receives any strength bonuses appropriate. For example, if a character has between 18/50 and 18/00 Strength, then <PRO_HISHER> Strength will just be set to 18/00. If a character has a Strength between 18/01 and 18/50, then <PRO_HISHER> Strength will become 18/50 + original percentage. If <PRO_HISHER> Strength is less than 18, then it will just become 18/50. However, this spell will actually lower a character's Strength if it is already 19 or more.~

@12199 = ~Dispel Magic
(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Protection
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

A Dispel Magic spell removes magical effects upon anyone within the area. This includes effects given from spells, potions and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Turning and Spell Deflection. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of the Dispel Magic is above the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is below the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 5% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 5% chance of failure. Similarly if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.

Note: While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect.~

(Abjuration, Evocation)

Level: 3
Sphere: Guardian
Range: 60 ft.
Duration: Permanent until discharged
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 12-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

A Glyph of Warding is a powerful inscription magically drawn to prevent unauthorized or hostile creatures from passing, entering, or opening. It can be used to guard a small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap on a chest or box. Any creature violating the warded area is subject to the magic it stores, although a successful Saving Throw vs. Spell enables the creature to escape the effects of the glyph. When the spell is cast, the priest weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. When the glyph is activated, it deals 1d4 points of electrical damage per level of the caster.~

(Abjuration)

Level: 1
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it creates a magical barrier around the recipient at a distance of one foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has two major effects: First, all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures against the protected creature receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll. Second, summoned demons cannot target the protected creature.~

Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The effects of a Protection From Fire spell last no longer than 3 rounds plus 1 round per level of the caster. When the spell is cast, it confers complete invulnerability to normal fires (torches, bonfires, oil fires, and the like) and to exposure to magical fires (fiery dragon breath, hell hound or pyrohydra breath, spells such as Burning Hands, Fireball, Fire Seeds, Fire Storm, Flame Strike, Meteor Swarm, and so on), absorbing 80% of all the damage dealt by such magical sources.~

Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell, the priest is usually able to remove a curse on an object, a person, or in the form of some undesired sending or evil presence. Note that the Remove Curse spell does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although the spell typically enables the person afflicted with any such cursed item to get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell, or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or higher.~

The priest instills courage in the spell's recipients, raising their morale to its highest. The recipients' morale will gradually reset to normal as the duration runs out. If the recipients are affected by magical fear, this is negated.~

Level: 1

Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When the priest casts a Sanctuary spell, it causes all of <PRO_HISHER> opponents to ignore <PRO_HISHER> existence as if <PRO_HESHE> were invisible. While protected by this spell, the subject cannot take direct offensive action without breaking the spell, but may use non-attack spells or otherwise act in any way that does not violate the prohibition against offensive action. This allows a warded priest to heal wounds, for example, or to Bless <PRO_HIMHER>self. The priest cannot cast spells on other creatures without ending the spell.~

When a priest casts the Barkskin spell upon a creature, its skin becomes as tough as bark, increasing its base Armor Class to 6, plus 1 for every 4 levels of the priest: Armor Class 5 at 4th level, Armor Class 4 at 8th, and so on. In addition, Saving Throws vs. all attack forms except magic gain a +1 bonus. This spell can be placed on the caster or on any other creature <PRO_HESHE> touches.~

(Alteration)

Level: 2
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is placed upon a creature, the creature's body is toughened to withstand heat and cold. Complete immunity to mild conditions (standing naked in the snow or reaching into an ordinary fire to pluck out a note) is gained. The recipient can somewhat resist intense heat or cold (whether natural or magical in origin), such as red-hot charcoal, a large amount of burning oil, flametongue swords, fire storms, fireballs, meteor swarms, red dragon's breath, frostbrand swords, ice storms, wands of frost, or white dragon's breath. In all of these cases, the temperature affects the creature to some extent. The recipient has all damage sustained by fire or cold reduced by 50%.~

Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius sphere
Saving Throw: Neg.

Upon casting this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible and spells cannot be cast. Each creature in the area must make a Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -5 penalty; if the save is failed then they are silenced for the duration of the spell. Note that this spell does not continue to affect the area after being cast; only those in the area at the time of the casting are affected by the silence.~

Level: 3
Sphere: Weather
Range: 80 ft.
Duration: 1 round/4 levels
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 360-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

Call Lightning must be cast outside; otherwise, it will not work, and the spell is wasted. The caster is able to call down one bolt of lightning per round. The spell has a duration of 1 round every 4 levels of the caster. Each bolt causes 2d8 points of electrical damage, plus an additional 1d8 points per level of the caster. Thus, an 8th-level caster will call down two bolts, each dealing 10d8 (2d8 + 8d8) points of damage. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at any of the priest's enemies. The first enemy struck by the lightning will be the enemy targeted. After that, any enemy (but no allies) may be struck by the ensuing lightning storm.~

When this spell is cast, party members within the area of effect are given a Strength score of 18/75. If a party member has a Strength score higher than this (either naturally, or through a magical item), then <PRO_HISHER> Strength is lowered to 18/75. The spell lasts for 1 turn, whereupon everyone's Strength returns to normal.~

Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

By means of the Chant spell, the priest brings special favor upon <PRO_HIMHER>self and <PRO_HISHER> party and causes harm to <PRO_HISHER> enemies. When the Chant spell is completed, all the priest's allies within the area of effect gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls, minimum damage/healing rolls, and Saving Throws. Furthermore, damage dice for all effects outside a weapon's base damage is reduced by 1. For example, a 6d6 fireball will do 6d5 damage, and an arrow of fire that deals 1d6 piercing plus 1d2 fire damage will deal 1d6 piercing plus 1 fire damage instead. The priest's enemies suffer the opposite effects.

Multiple chants are not cumulative.~

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When a priest casts a Find Traps spell, all traps—concealed normally or magically—of magical or mechanical nature become apparent to <PRO_HIMHER>. A trap is any device or magical ward that meets three criteria: it can inflict a sudden or unexpected result; the spellcaster would view the result as undesirable or harmful; and the creator specifically intended the harmful or undesirable result as such. Thus traps include glyphs and similar spells or devices. Due to the nature of the spell, the caster must stop to concentrate 1 per round which will effectively interrupt any action. This however will not affect spellcasting.~

Sphere: Divination
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

A Know Alignment spell enables the priest to exactly read the aura of a creature. If the creature rolls a successful Saving Throw vs. Spell, the caster learns nothing about that particular creature from the casting. When a character is hit by this spell, it will glow red if evil, green if good, and white if neutral. Certain magical devices negate the power of the Know Alignment spell.~

(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 2
Sphere: Animal
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 person or mammal
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell to negate the effect.

If the spell's recipient fails <PRO_HISHER> Saving Throw (with a +3 modifier), <PRO_HESHE> regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give <PRO_HIMHER> orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harms—or attempts to harm—the charmed person by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed person, the Charm spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while <PRO_HESHE> was charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where <PRO_HESHE> is charmed.~

This spell holds animals rigidly immobile and in place. Only normal- and giant-sized animals are affected by this spell; monsters such as wyverns, ankhegs, and carrion crawlers do not count as animals. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster; every enemy within 4 ft. of the target is also affected. Those who succeed on their Saving Throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

This spell holds one or more humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile and in place for one turn. This includes: brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level Fighter could be held, while an ogre could not. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every enemy within 4 ft. of the target is also affected. Those who succeed on their Saving Throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.

Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

By using this spell, the priest can create a small magical pebble, which then flies out and hits a target opponent. The stone deals 1d4 points of damage to whomever it hits. The stones are considered +1 weapons for determining if a creature can be struck (those struck only by magical weapons, for instance), although they do not have an attack or damage bonus.~

With this spell, the caster causes a blazing ray of red-hot fire to spring forth from <PRO_HISHER> hand. This blade-like ray is wielded as if it were a sword that the caster already knows how to use, hence there are no bonuses or penalties. If the caster successfully hits with the flame blade in melee combat, the creature struck suffers 1d4 points of slashing damage, plus an additional 1d2+4 points of fire damage. However, it is not a magical weapon in the normal sense of the term, so creatures struck only by magical weapons are not harmed by it.~

When the priest calls down a Flame Strike spell, a vertical column of fire roars downward in the exact location called for by the caster. The target must roll a Saving Throw vs. Spell. Failure means the creature sustains 1d8 points of damage per level of the caster; otherwise, the damage is halved.~

It strikes as a magical weapon with a bonus of +1 for every 6 experience levels (or fraction) of the caster, up to a total of +3 to the attack roll and +3 to the damage roll for a 13th-level caster. The base damage inflicted when it scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war hammer (1d4+1 vs. opponents of man-size or smaller and 1d4 upon larger opponents, plus the magical bonus).~

Duration: 1 round + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of this spell gains the benefits of a Bless spell (+1 to attack rolls and Saving Throws) and a special bonus of 1d8 additional Hit Points for the duration of the spell. The Aid spell enables the recipient to actually have more Hit Points than <PRO_HISHER> current maximum. The bonus Hit Points are lost first when the recipient takes damage and may not be regained by curative magic.

Example: A 1st-level Fighter has 8 Hit Points, suffers 2 points of damage (8 - 2 = 6), then receives an Aid spell that grants <PRO_HIMHER> 5 additional Hit Points. The Fighter now has 11 Hit Points, 3 of which are temporary. If <PRO_HESHE> is then hit for 7 points of damage, 4 normal Hit Points and all 3 temporary Hit Points are lost. The Fighter then receives a Cure Light Wounds spell that heals 4 points of damage, restoring <PRO_HIMHER> to <PRO_HISHER> original 8 Hit Points.~

@13138 = ~History of Cormyr:

Cormyr dates its years from the founding of House Obarskyr 1,342 years ago, the first of the noble houses and the line of its kings. For the bulk of this time, Cormyr was little more than a single city (Suzail) and a few fortified outposts. At times the monarch was forced by rebellion and intrigue to rule from those outposts instead of from the throne. King Azoun is the fourth of his name and the 71st of his line.

The land has been officially at peace for many years—since Rhigaerd overthrew the last of the border raiders. However, Cormyrean armies have taken part in many actions in nearby regions, recently mustering its forces to face Gondegal, the rebel of Arabel; to occupy Tilverton on the marches of the Dalelands; and to lead a crusade against the great Tuigan horde invading from the east. One wit has noted that "Yes, the land is at peace, but the army has to keep busy." In addition to pursuing major actions, Cormyrean patrols often skirmish with bandits on the roads in the north and west, and are at present battling orcs and other creatures north and east of Cormyr in Tilver's Gap and Shadow Gap. Both of these areas are threatened by raiders who will menace Cormyr itself if they ever overrun Tilverton. Cormyr has built a fortress, Castle Crag, to defend the kingdom from attacks from that quarter, and maintains the High Horn to protect against attacks from the West.~

@13142 = ~History of Gondegal the Lost King:

Arabel, long under the dominion of Cormyr, for a time became the center of a swordsman's empire. This swordsman was Gondegal, the Lost King, who in the Year of the Dragon (1352 DR) attempted to carve a kingdom for himself centered on Arabel. It was to extend north to the Desertsmouth Mountains, south and west of Wyvernwater and the farms outlying from Eveningstar, and east to Tilver's Gap and the mountain passes.

In the years following, people would say that Gondegal's reach was no longer than his blade. He could not hold any of the territory against the might of Cormyr, Sembia, Daggerdale, Tilverton, and several of the other Dales—all of whom he drew the blood and ire of in the making of his throne.

Gondegal ruled for less than a season, though he reigned officially for scarcely eight days. The remainder of his rule was spent fighting here and there against one foe or another in the lands he claimed. His troops were largely mercenary, and his treasury of seized goods was small and soon gone. One night Gondegal's force simply melted away before the advancing troops of Cormyr, and was gone. King Azoun IV retook Arabel on that morn without wetting a blade.

No one has ever found the body of Gondegal; he is known to have fled north and then east via Teshwave, but then his fate becomes a matter of conflicting rumor and legend. Some believe he still lives with a score or more of loyal followers, keeping court in the wilds somewhere, a careful and ruthless bandit who takes care that none survive his attacks to carry tales anywhere. When entire caravans vanish at times anywhere between the High Dale and far-off Impiltur, he is blamed by talk in the taverns.

Gondegal was said to be a tall, gray-haired warrior of considerable personal skill and intelligence. His badge was a gray wolf's head, face on, with red eyes. Caravan guards often warn merchants to beef up the escort on a particular caravan, "else thy gold'll soon be gilding Gondegal's throne." Gondegal was an impeccable swordsman and somewhat chaotic in his self professed neutral alignment. If he does indeed yet live, the magic or treasure he carries, and who his allies might be, are all unknown.

Gondegal's reign had a great influence on the King of Cormyr, at that time in his second decade of rule. Not only was Azoun forced to put down an effective rebellion in his own country, he was forced to pay more attention to matters outside Suzail, to become the ruler of a nation as opposed to a city-state. Further, the bloodless assault on Arabel was Azoun's first true experience at the head of his army, and the joy of "freeing" the people of Arabel is one that remains with him.~

@13144 = ~History of Luiren, Land of the Halflings:

The halflings of Luiren claim that it is the original homeland of halflings in the realms. Although other halflings may disagree with this, it is true that Luiren was settled hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years ago.

Luiren's history is one of conquerors and subjugation. Throughout the centuries, the halflings have been conquered by the barbarians who used to inhabit Dambrath, by the kingdom of Estagund, and even once by the monsters of Beldorn. In every case, the invaders were eventually defeated because they made the mistake of underestimating the halflings due to their small stature. A good bit of mischief, mayhem, and general trouble-making by the halflings also helped end the occupations.

Currently, Luiren is enjoying unprecedented prosperity. The halflings are currently taking advantage of their relationship with the nation of Durpar; their biggest customer and greatest competitor. Also, through these close ties with Durpar, Luiren has protected itself against another Dambraii invasion. The rulers of Dambrath must know that if they begin to expand to the east, they will arouse the ire of Durpar, as well as Var and Estagund. The threat of a trade embargo and/or military consequences have kept this aggressive nation away from the Luireners.~

@13145 = ~History of Sembia:

The land of Sembia was settled by humans coming to the Sea of Fallen Stars from the south, and was originally chosen for its stands of huge, high-quality iliyr-wood timber so prized in shipbuilding. However, as the forests were cleared over the years, the treecutters came into increasing conflict with elves that feared the loss of their entire wood. This would undoubtedly have occurred, had not the hastily gathered mercenary troops of the fledgling land been defeated by the elves at Singing Arrows (884 DR). This battle convinced distant Chondath to abandon its holdings in the region and allow the immigrant Sembians to establish their independence (though as little more than a collection of rival city-states, much like the Moonsea or Vast of today). It also set the stage for the appearance of the Raven.

The young country grew strong as farms prospered in the newly cleared lands. Craftsmen arrived from the south to take advantage of this chance to acquire land and wealth, bringing their trades with them. Rauthauvyr the Raven unified the city-states and towns in the face of the continuing "elven menace", and insisted on maintaining a standing army, which he kept in practice by policing Sembia's borders and improving its roads. At this time (913 DR), Sembia became as a true nation.

The Moonsea's (Dragon Sea's) mineral wealth was discovered by humankind at about this time, and pressure began to grow for a trade road through the elven woods to make Sembia the world's gateway to all these riches. The Raven went alone as an envoy to the Elven Court. There, he asked the elders of their council to approve a road, open to humans, linking Sembia to the shores of the Dragon Sea (an earlier road had been destroyed during the conflict and was now overgrown). Raven proposed that the elves choose the route and retain control of it and the woods around it, so that no woodcutting or human settlement would occur. The elves had earlier made similar arrangements with the Dalesmen and had no difficulty with the concept of such an agreement. However, the inhabitants of Velarsdale (now Harrowdale) refused the proposal, not wanting or needing such a road at that time (curious, since later a ruler of Harrowdale commissioned the disastrous Halfaxe Trail). The elves, not wishing to offend long-time allies, refused Raven's request.

Rebuffed, the Raven then threatened to exterminate the isolated elves in Amothoi, the last embattled remnant of the elves in Sembia, if the Elven Court did not cooperate. If the road were built, however, they would be free to trade, or not trade, as they wished. The elves agreed under this pressure, and Sembia's financial future was secured. Hillsfar, on the shores of the Dragon Sea, became a commercial meeting ground between humankind and elves, as did Elventree. The route the elves chose ran past the base of the Standing Stone as a reminder of earlier, less-hostile dealings between humans and elves. Over the years the elves of Amothoi came north to join their brethren or slipped away to seek Evermeet, leaving their wood to gradually disappear.

 Sembia grew rich under merchant leaders of increasing wisdom, such as Saer (for whom Saerb was named) and Selgar (for whom Chancelgaunt was renamed as Selgaunt). Before his death, Rauthauvyr the Raven saw that these merchants had a strong standing council of merchant elders to advise them and to ensure that no ruler could hold onto power by force of arms. Then this farsighted man, creator of a nation, now half-blind and infirm from old war wounds, rode north into the elven woods and disappeared. None know what happened to him or where his bones lie, save perhaps some few elder elves.~

@13146 = ~History of Shadowdale—The Fall of Azmaer, Last Drow Marshall of the Twisted Tower:

The drow rule of Shadowdale lasted until the early 900s Dale Reckoning, when the increased human population in the area brought the dark elves into conflict with their now more numerous neighbors. The humans were the Dalesmen who a millennium earlier had crossed the Dragon Reach and made peace with the elves of Myth Drannor, settling at the borders of the great woods that was the elven home. The drow soon found themselves under continual attack, and most of those who held overground settlements retreated back below. The last powerful drow leader was Azmaer, the marshall of the Twisted Tower in its last drow-held days. Azmaer oversaw the last retreat of the drow holdings in the face of a human uprising, and held the citadel against a year-long siege. With supplies and slaves brought up from the Underdark directly into the tower, the drow could have conceivably held out forever; however, a human slave (family histories in the Dales indicate a number of possible individuals) poisoned the well in the Tower and the citadel was easily overrun. Azmaer's body was not found among the dead, leading some to believe that he escaped back into the depths to rejoin his people. Noting the fact that he would have had to explain to his matriarch how he lost Shadowdale, it is much more likely that, should Azmaer have survived, he went into voluntary exile, hiding from both human and drow. Given that this occurred only 400 years ago, it is certainly possible that Azmaer still lives.~

The past hundred years have been an example of the best and worst of the lords of Shadowdale. All have been nonnative to the Dalelands, though all made the land their home. A century ago the lord of the Dales was one Joadath, a stiff-necked agnostic who denied the power of any god, good or evil, and used force to back up his beliefs. During this time there was a great deal of religious persecution, including a massacre of Tyrists on Watcher's Knoll. Joadath was eventually killed by a beast of the nether planes summoned by parties unknown, which then proceeded to rampage through the Dale. The beast was killed and Shadowdale rescued by the spellcasters Aumry and Sylune. Aumry was proclaimed lord by acclamation.~

@13150 = ~History of Shadowdale—Jyordhan the False Lord:

Lord Aumry was assassinated by Zhentarim agents, who in turn were captured and killed by the warrior Jyordhan. Jyordhan, with the Pendant of Ashaba in hand (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), proceeded to present himself as the new lord, and was so acclaimed by the people. It was unknown to the people that Jyordhan was also an agent of the Zhentarim, and that the entire proceeding had actually been a ruse.

Jyordhan abandoned the Twisted Tower, instead establishing himself in Castle Krag east of Shadowdale. His court was soon overrun with agents of the Black Network. When the people eventually revolted, Zhentil Keep sent peace-keeping forces to maintain Jyordhan's rule. Sylune, Lord Aumry's widow, now aware of the deception but a firm pacifist, did her best to keep the Dale healthy and intact during Jyordhan's evil rule.~

@13151 = ~History of Shadowdale—Khelben Kills Jyordhan:

Lord Jyordhan's rule of Shadowdale ended when he encountered Khelben Arunsun, also called the Blackstaff. The story at the time was that Jyordhan accepted an invitation from Khelben to visit Waterdeep, and there he took ill and died. In reality, Jyordhan ambushed Khelben as the mage was leaving Shadowdale, and the Blackstaff killed him. In either case, Khelben took hold of the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales) and returned to Waterdeep with it, promising to send a suitable candidate for lordship to the Dales. Jyordhan had ruled for five years, and without his advocacy, Castle Krag was abandoned and the Zhentil Keep troops routed. Jyordhan's previously chosen successor was a Melvauntan named Lyran, but without the Pendant this individual was considered a pretender to the throne.~

@13152 = ~History of Shadowdale—Lords Accepted by Acclamation:

This acclamation of the people has formed the basis for choosing the lord of Shadowdale since the routing of the evil Lord Jyordhan by Khelben Blackstaff. Usually a predecessor will step down as opposed to dying in office, and his chosen successor will be approved by the populace at large. This system has had its drawbacks, as will be shown below, but in general, it has served the independent, self-willed people of the Dale very well. They have avoided the "genetic lottery of which good bureaucracies and bad kingships are made" (a quote from the venerable Elminster). The symbol of the lordship is the Pendant of Ashaba, a device owned by the original wizard, and used to determine the rightful lord of the Dale.~

During the period when Khelben Blackstaff held the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), Sylune (widow of the murdered Lord Aumry) was the de facto ruler of Shadowdale, though these years were known as the Time of No Lords. Sylune and an adventuring company known as Mane's Band were responsible for driving out the Zhentil Keep forces and keeping at bay the monsters in the area. The Twisted Tower, the traditional seat of leadership, remained uninhabited following its abandonment by the evil Lord Jyordhan, and neither Sylune nor the companions of Mane's Band wished to assume the mantle of leader. With time, Mane's Band passed on to other lands and adventures.~

@13154 = ~History of Shadowdale—Doust Sulwood Becomes Lord of Shadowdale:

Three winters following his defeat of the evil Lord Jyordhan, Khelben Blackstaff found a suitable candidate to assume leadership of the Dales, or rather a group of candidates. They were the Knights of Myth Drannor, so named to show their interest in the elven territories and their connection with the elven peoples, and Khelben gave them the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the Lordship) in return for services rendered to himself and to Shadowdale. Their leader, the ranger Florin Falconhand, refused the honor of the lordship. It was therefore passed to Doust Sulwood, who was made the new lord with the support of Florin and Sylune (wife of the murdered Lord Aumry), and apparently also the secret support of Khelben as well.

Doust reoccupied the Twisted Tower, driving out the last agents of the Black Network. He also reinstituted many of Ashaba's democratic ideals, including the Lord's Court where all citizens may speak freely and air their grievances without threat of reprisal. Doust ruled for five years and proved to be a capable ruler, beloved by the people. The regular presence of the Knights of Myth Drannor did much to ensure the protection of the area, particularly against incursions by Lyran Nanther the Pretender. Lyran was to have been Jyordhan's named replacement, but with the Zhentarim routed there was little validity to the claim.~

@13155 = ~History of Shadowdale—Elminster Moves to Shadowdale:

It is of note that during the time that Doust Sulwood of the Knights of Myth Drannor assumed the role of Lord of Shadowdale, Elminster took up residence in the area. A semi-regular visitor up to that time, he took possession of a low, abandoned tower at the foot of the Old Skull, and declared himself to be officially in retirement. The nature of that retirement varies from active involvement in local affairs to long-term vacations on other planes. The natives of the Dale have come to the understanding that they cannot always count on the powerful mage being in residence in times of need or danger, but when he is present in these circumstances his aid is usually given.~

Doust Sulwood, recommended to the position by Khelben Blackstaff, ruled Shadowdale as lord for five years. "Seems like a millennium," he was oft known to have reported, and the tedium of court life and the lure of adventure eventually caused him to retire his position and rejoin the Knights of Myth Drannor in regular adventuring. He handed the Pendant of Ashaba (symbol of the Lordship) on to one of the younger Knights, a Waterdhavian noble named Mourngrym Amcathra. Mourngrym had been dispatched by Khelben from Waterdeep for other purposes, but Doust liked both the young man's straightforward honesty and his willingness to shoulder the burden of protecting the small community from myriad dangers. Time has proven this choice a wise one.~

The implications of Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun "choosing" the last two lords of Shadowdale (Doust Sulwood and Mourngrym Amcathra) were not lost on the Dale's powerful neighbor to the south, Cormyr. An agent was sent northward to divine Mourngrym's true intentions and to guarantee the Dale's continued good relationship with the throne of the Purple Dragon. The agent was a rogue named Shaerl Rowanmantle, sent by Vangerdahast (though all paperwork on this matter has been curiously incinerated in Suzail, so all is hearsay and tale). Shaerl discovered more than she intended and fell in love with young Mourngrym. The two married and became the lord and lady of Shadowdale. Shaerl's loyalty is now to her husband and to the land they co-rule. This was probably not the intention of the Cormyreans.~

@13158 = ~History of Shadowdale—Mourngrym's Rule:

Since being recommended to the position by outgoing Lord Doust Sulwood, Lord Mourngrym Amcathra's rule of Shadowdale has been less peaceful than he had hoped. The First Battle of Shadowdale occurred in the Year of the Prince (1357 DR), and involved Daleland forces routing those of Lyran the Pretender. Lyran has made repeated attempts to gain the Lordship, as was intended by the former Zhentish puppet, Lord Jyordhan. While significant, this battle pales when compared to the larger battle fought on the same site between Bane-led Zhentil Keep forces and the Dales during the Time of Troubles (1358 DR/0 PR). When the Battle of Shadowdale is referred to (without a number), it usually means this second battle. In addition, Mourngrym has had to deal with a large number of skirmishes, incursions, a possible invasion from below, explosions, and other sundry disasters.

Mourngrym and Shaerl have one child, Scotti, who is now nine winters old. By the customs of the area, he is not considered the heir apparent, and another suitable warrior or mage may take the reins of power of the small community. Most feel that Mourngrym will hold the Pendant until his son has reached his maturity, then abdicate in young Scotti's favor once he takes his grown name. If this happens, it will be the first occasion of the lordship of Shadowdale passing down through a family.~

@13160 = ~History of the Bell in the Depths:

One of the great and mysterious sites in the Moonsea area, the Bell in the Depths, is connected with legendary Northkeep, an island kingdom that was the first great citadel of humankind in these cold lands. Northkeep was a great and magical city, and it was under the protection of these magics that humanity first began to press back the orc hordes and take command of the sea.

The power of Northkeep made it an obvious target for orcs, giants, and other evil races. However, these creatures were not inclined towards sea actions, and Northkeep seemed safe until the day when (according to legend) 40,000 inhuman mages, shamans, witch doctors, and priests of all foul races gathered on the northern shore of the Moonsea and began to chant, bringing the vengeance of their gods down upon the human interlopers. The gods (at least some of them) came and destroyed their priests for disturbing them, but also sank Northkeep beneath the waves.

The upper reaches of Northkeep—its slender, now-broken spires—can be seen beneath the water by boats that sail nearby. This is not attempted often, however, as the region is said to be haunted by the original defenders of Northkeep, seeking company in their watch over the Cold Lands. On fog-ridden nights the bells of the tallest towers, despite being submerged, can be heard as far away as Hillsfar.~

@13161 = ~History of the Chosen of Mystra:

The reason why Mystra, the Goddess of Magic, invested a portion of her divine might in mortals is not known. One of the more popular theories, and one that is gaining more support in light of the goddess' other actions during that period, is that Mystra foresaw the Time of Troubles (and her own passing at the hands of Helm) and chose to give some of her power to mortals in order to ensure that her successor (the female mage Midnight, as it turned out) would have a number of nearly immortal allies in the struggle against the schemes of the gods (the now dead Bane, Myrkul, and Bhaal) who precipitated the Time of Troubles by stealing the Tablets of Fate. The theory goes on to suggest that Mystra informed Azuth at approximately the Year of the Rising Flame (0 DR), more than 1,300 years before the Time of Troubles, that some of her power must be put into the hands of mortals who would then become known as Mystra's Chosen. This power would sleep within the bodies of those mortals, allowing Mystra to call on it only with their permission. It would give the Chosen the innate ability to heal quickly, and would give them life spans far greater than those of ordinary mortals. Mystra speculated that these mortals might be able to call on her power and thereby gain some special abilities, but that these powers would not rival those of a deity. (See "Powers" below.)

The Goddess of All Magic then began to select mortals she thought to be suitable. One of the first was the young mage Elminster, and she also singled out a promising wizard named Khelben Arunsun. Both have proved to be worthy and capable receptacles of her power, but Mystra's other early attempts to invest her power in living humans were unsuccessful, and she came to realize that only very few mortals were of stern enough substance to contain such power within themselves without being destroyed or corrupted. Even though some people aside from Elminster and Khelben may have possessed the requisite strength, it is possible that having lived for years prior to being visited by Mystra had set them on a path from which they were not able to deviate. Whatever the reason, the problem needed to be solved. To get around the difficulty, Mystra devised a plan to use herself as a vessel to breed individuals who could be nurtured and acclimated to her power from the very beginnings of their lives.

For the father of these individuals, she picked the best example of human stock she could find: Dornal Silverhand, a nobleman and a former Harper who lived near Neverwinter. Mystra then possessed the body of Elue Shundar, a half-elven sorceress whom Dornal was already attracted to. Mystra revealed her presence and her plan to Elue, who happily and eagerly agreed to have the goddess share her body. Elue had been reluctant, but under the influence of Mystra the woman became a seductress, and Dornal found his advances being suddenly returned with great fervor.

Dornal and Mystra/Elue were wed in the Year of Drifting Stars (760 DR). The first of seven daughters, Anastra Sylune, was born the following winter. Sylune's six sisters emerged at one-year intervals thereafter: Endue Alustriel, Ambara Dove, Ethena Astorma (she prefers the shortened "Storm" these days), Anamanue Laeral, Alassra Shentrantra (known today as the Simbul), and Er'sseae Qilue. These siblings have become known in Realmsian lore as the Seven Sisters.

Dornal, who had been kept in the dark about his wife's true nature through the years (presumably because Mystra didn't want to risk losing his services), was disappointed and nearly distraught by the time his sixth child was born; he had always wanted sons as well as daughters. More importantly, he was seeing his wife deteriorate right before his eyes. The strain of coexisting with the goddess all these years had turned Elue into a withered shell—in essence a lich, clinging to life only because Mystra's power was within her.

When Elue was carrying the seventh child, Dornal consulted a priest who told him his wife had been possessed by an entity of great magical power. To spare both of them any further agony, he attempted to slay his wife's physical form by severing her head from her body.

As soon as he had done this, Mystra was forced to reveal herself to him, and she went on to explain her scheme. Just as she had worried would happen, Dornal was aghast at how he and his wife had been used by the goddess. He turned his back on the corpse of his wife, abandoned his lands and his children, and vanished into the North. Mystra bore him no ill will, and in fact protected him for the final 30 years of his life. When Dornal finally did meet his end he called out to Mystra, and the goddess granted him continued existence as her servant. Now known as the Watcher, Dornal Silverhand travels the world unseen by mortals on a continuing mission to locate candidates to swell the ranks of the Chosen and to identify possible threats to Mystra and her minions.~

@13162 = ~History of the Dales and the Elven Court:

The founding of the Dalelands long preceded the creation of any of the existing Dales by hundreds of years, and the year numbering system known as Dalereckoning is actually a commemoration of humankind being given permission to settle in the lands north and west of the Inner Sea. Most of the current Dales are relative newcomers, the older having been abandoned, destroyed, or overrun long ago. In those ancient days, when Suzail and Chondathan (now called Saerloon) were mere coastal trading posts, the elves who ruled this forest entertained a request from settlers from the East; refugees and farmers from far-off Impiltur and Damara. This request was to farm and settle the borders of the great forest Cormanthor, in particular the rich delves and dales along the rivers Arkhen and Ashaba. These newcomers did not wish to lumber or clear the inhabited forest, but only to settle on the rich territories on its edges, and unlike some other settlers (early Sembia comes to mind) were willing to ask permission.

The lords of the Elven Court granted that request in return for aid from these new Dalelanders against outside aggression, both monstrous (orcs and goblins from the lands of Thar) and human (the rising powers in Cormyr and Sembia). In commemoration of this pact, humans and elves raised the Standing Stone that is now seen where the Moonsea Ride reaches Rauthauvyr's Road, the road from Essembra to Hillsfar. It is from the date of the raising of this stone that Dalereckoning is counted. According to the pact made, the Dalesmen would only settle those regions that were unforested or unclaimed by the elves. As the elven woods receded under the axes of further invaders and settlers, old Dales perished and new ones came into being along the borders of the woods. People, both good and bad, have raised petty nations in the Dalelands since, though any one Dale that turned against the pact would have to deal with the others. Each of the Dales is a large swath of farms and fields, with a few scattered settlements and usually one central marketplace, capital, or Dale center. These centers are often, but not always, named after the Dales they are in, adding to the confusion as to what is a Daleland's territory.

The Dales are not city-states, for their largest groupings of population rate as towns at best, and they lack the defensive walls common throughout the Heartlands. They are neither true nations in the fashion of Cormyr or Sembia, and occupy a gray middle ground wherein they are nothing more, or less, than Dales.

Each Dale has slightly different laws, customs, and military organizations. Many rely on the work of charismatic heroes and adventuring companies for aid in times of trouble, and a large number of these individuals use the region as a base. This attraction for adventurers is further increased by the large number of elven and pre-elven ruins in the area and the departure of the Elven Court for Evermeet, leaving the woods open for exploration and exploitation.

The history of the Dales is filled with battles and attacks on its various members. In the Year of the Worm (1356 DR), Scardale, under the command of Lashan Aumersair, launched a number of swift attacks, conquering a number of the surrounding Dales. A coalition of forces from the others, as well as Sembia, Cormyr, and Zhentil Keep crushed the invaders and occupied Scardale. During the Time of Troubles (1358 DR/0 PR), Shadowdale was attacked by Zhentil Keep. More recently, the Dalelands have committed forces to a unified army under King Azoun IV of Cormyr to turn back the Tuigan Invasion (1360 DR).~

@13163 = ~History of the Dead Three: 'KNUCKLEBONES, SKULL BOWLING, AND THE EMPTY THRONE'

In ages past there was but one god of strife, death, and the dead, and he was known as Jergal, Lord of the End of Everything. Jergal fomented and fed on the discord among mortals and powers alike. When beings slew each other in their quest for power or in their hatred, he welcomed them into his shadowy kingdom of eternal gloom. As all things died, everything came to him eventually, and over time he built his power into a kingdom unchallenged by any other god. Eventually, however, he grew tired of his duties for he knew them too well. Without challenge there is nothing, and in nothingness there is only gloom. In such a state, the difference between absolute power and absolute powerlessness is undetectable.

During this dark era, there arose three powerful mortals—Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul—who lusted after the power Jergal wielded. The trio forged an unholy pact, agreeing that they would dare to seek such ultimate power or die in the attempt. Over the length and breadth of the realms they strode, seeking powerful magic and spells and defying death at every turn. No matter what monster they confronted or what spells they braved, the three mortals emerged unscathed at every turn. Eventually the trio destroyed one of the Seven Lost Gods, and they each seized a portion of his divine essence for themselves.

The trio then journeyed into the Gray Waste and sought out the Castle of Bone. Through armies of skeletons, legions of zombies, hordes of noncorporeal undead, and a gauntlet of liches they battled. Eventually they reached the object of their lifelong quest—the Bone Throne.

"I claim this throne of evil," shouted Bane the tyrant. "I'll destroy you before you can raise a finger," threatened Bhaal the assassin. "And I shall imprison your essence for eternity," promised Myrkul the necromancer.

Jergal arose from his throne with a weary expression and said, "The Throne is yours. I have grown weary of this empty power. Take it if you wish—I promise to serve and guide you as your seneschal until you grow comfortable with the position." Before the stunned trio could react, the Lord of the Dead continued: "Who among you shall rule?"

The trio immediately fell to fighting amongst themselves while Jergal looked on with indifference. When eventually it appeared that either they would all die of exhaustion or battle on for an eternity, the Lord of the End of Everything intervened. "After all you have sacrificed, would you come away with nothing? Why don't you divide the portfolios of the office and engage in a game of skill for them?" asked Jergal.

Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul considered the god's offer and agreed. Jergal took the heads of his three most powerful liches and gave them to the trio that they would compete by bowling the skulls. Each mortal rolled a skull across the Gray Waste, having agreed that the winner would be he who bowled the farthest.

Malar the Beastlord arrived to visit Jergal at this moment. After quickly ascertaining that the winner of the contest would get all of Jergal's power, he chased off after the three skulls to make sure that the contest would be halted until he had a chance to participate for part of the prize. Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul again fell to fighting as it was obvious their sport was ruined, and again Jergal intervened. "Why don't you allow Lady Luck to decide so you don't have to share with the Beast?"

The trio agreed, and Jergal broke off his skeletal finger bones and gave them to the players. When Malar returned from chasing the skulls, he found that the trio had just finished a game of knucklebones.

Bane cried out triumphantly, "As winner, I choose to rule for all eternity as the ultimate tyrant. I can induce hatred and strife at my whim, and all will bow down before me while in my kingdom."

Myrkul, who had won second place, declared, "But I choose the dead, and by doing so I truly win, because all you are lord over, Bane, will eventually be mine. All things must die—even gods."

Bhaal, who finished third, demurred, "I choose death, and it is by my hand that all that you rule Lord Bane will eventually pass to Lord Myrkul. Both of you must pay honor to me and obey my wishes, since I can destroy your kingdom, Bane, by murdering your subjects, and I can starve your kingdom, Myrkul, by staying my hand."

Malar growled in frustration, but could do nothing, and yet again only the beasts were left for him.

And Jergal merely smiled, for he had been delivered.~

@13165 = ~History of the Drow, The Descent:

We know very little of the Ilythiiri, or "elves of the South," before this crucial event. Even then they were known as "dark elves," for the hue of their skins. They dwelt in the jungles and hot forests of the South. A proud, warlike, culturally advanced (some sages of other elven peoples say "decadent") folk, the Ilythiiri attacked all neighbors, including other elven tribes. Their cruel raids and depredations, ordered by warlike nobility and the clergy of their two cruel deities, Ghaunadaur and Lolth, forced elves, humans, dwarves, and others to ally against them.

Defeated in a series of titanic magical battles, the dark elves fled into underground warrens they had earlier discovered. This event, known as "the Descent," marked the end of the drow as a surface-dwelling race.~

@13166 = ~History of the Drow, The Dark Wars:

The warlike drow nature did not change when they escaped their surface foes during the Descent. In fact, they immediately launched a series of wars to establish territories in the Underdark. They began by stealing and seizing dwarven magical items and using them against the dwarves—establishing an enmity that is still strong today.

The drow then fought among themselves, noble against noble, priest against priestess, for rule of their new realm. This all-out war ended amid great magical explosions that brought down the roof of the largest dwarven cavern they had seized, great Bhaerynden. The ceiling collapsed entirely, burying many drow and the shattered dwarven cities. The cavern, now open to the sky, became known as the Great Rift. The surviving drow nobles gathered what people, slaves, and equipment they could seize and fled into the Underdark in search of places to dwell. "The Scattering" brought about the many rival, self-interested cities where most drow live today.~

@13168 = ~History of the Last March of the Giants:

East of the Great Rift in the Eastern Shaar once stood a land of the titans. This empire rose at the dawn of time in Faerûn, and its lords thought to challenge the gods in their arrogance. In punishment, the powers cursed the reigning monarch of the land with fascination and his brethren with devotion. The powers then dropped a star onto the land. The impact of the fallen star created a huge valley later known as the Sea of Fallen Stars. Slowly picking up speed, the ball rolled through the titan nation and onward to the south.

Unable to contain his curiosity, the titan king ran off after the bouncing sphere and his devoted followers dutifully followed his tracks. The meteorite rolled on and on until it reached the Great Sea and vanished into the depths. The monarch dove into the sea, and, lemminglike, the entire titan race dove in after him, never to be seen again.

Ashamed at the destruction they had wrought, the powers vowed to keep both curiosity and loyalty firmly in check to avoid such disasters in the future. They have done so to this day, preventing both new ideas from being pursued with any speed and the intelligent races of Toril from ever fully cooperating.~

@13169 = ~History of the Moonsea:

The Moonsea has a long history as the border between the elven lands to the south and the darker, more sinister lands of the Ride and Thar, home of dragons and giant and ogre tribes in great multitudes. The deep sea was an excellent barrier to the raiders, as those tribes who sought invasion had to detour around and through the lands that would eventually hold Yulash, Zhentil Keep, and Hillsfar.

The first true settlement in Moonsea was Northkeep, a shining citadel established as a beacon of civilization and a jumping-off point for merchants seeking trade with the dwarves of the North—including not only Tethyamar, but the clans of the Cold Lands—who traded their metalwork and craft for much-needed magic. In the end, Northkeep was sunk beneath the icy waters of the Moonsea by the inhuman forces, and humankind suffered one of many setbacks in the region.

So has been the nature of human habitation of this region since the beginning. Human settlements thrive for a few years, usually through sheer willpower and on the strength of a sharp sword, and then are overrun by goblins, orcs, dragons, beholders, or giants. Phlan has fallen and risen again. Yulash is a ruin where a decade ago there was a thriving town. Hulburg and Sulasspryn are empty hulks. Each of the cities of the Moonsea seems threatened with extinction in its turn, then is rebuilt.

This cycle may be the reason that only the strongest and the most savage survive, even prosper, in the lands of the Moonsea. The greatest cities—Hillsfar, Mulmaster, and the impenetrable Zhentil Keep—are all ruled by evil people who control their lands with iron grips. The lesser cities, Elventree, Phlan, and Thentia, may be less evil, but have a strong, independent, almost chaotic nature. In many ways the Moonsea is a frontier, with a frontier mentality.~

@13170 = ~History of the North—The First Flowering:

For millennia, gold elves dwelt in Illefarn (where Waterdeep now stands) and Eaerlann (along the River Shining). From their ornate forest cities, they traded with emerging human nations like Netheril and Illusk and repulsed the attacks of the goblin races. Meanwhile, dwarven clans united as the nation of Delzoun, named for the dwarf who forged the union. The nation, existing primarily underground, extended from the Ice Mountains to the Nether Mountains. Silver Moon Pass was its western border and the Narrow Sea its eastern shore. Orcs came from north of the Spine of the World but were turned back in great slaughter by the elves. To this day, this is the homeland and stronghold for orcs and similar races.~

@13171 = ~History of the North—The Crown Wars:

Humans immigrated in bands from the Shining Sea and up to the Sword Coast. They became seafarers, striking out across the waves to the Moonshaes, Mintarn, Ruathym, and the northern islands. Elves engaged in an unceasing war against each other, with the humans and orcs taking over the resulting ruins. Perhaps the greatest calamity to befall the Fair Folk was the Dark Disaster, a killing magic that took the form of a dark, burning cloud. It enshrouded the kingdom of Miyeritar, and when it faded away some months later, not an elf lived—nor were trees left, only an open, blasted moor: the High Moor.

All was not dark for the elves. Although in retreat, as barbarian humans and orc hordes grew in strength, their power rose in the Elven Court and Evereska (remaining a stronghold to this day). They conceived of cooperation between dwarves, kindly humans, and other elves for mutual survival against orcs, marauding humans, and the tide of beasts (ogres, bugbears, trolls, goblins, gnolls, and other nonhuman creatures) led by the rising power of giants. Astonishingly, in at least three places—the Fallen Kingdoms and the cities of Silverymoon and Myth Drannor—they succeeded with shining grace.

To the east, on the sandy shores of the calm and shining Narrow Sea, human fishing villages grew into small towns and then joined together as the nation of Netheril. Sages believe the fishing towns were unified by a powerful human wizard who had discovered a book of great magic power that had survived from the Days of Thunder—a book that legend calls the Nether Scrolls. Under this nameless wizard and those who followed, Netheril rose in power and glory, becoming both the first human land in the North and the most powerful. Some say this discovery marked the birth of human wizardry, since before then, mankind had only shamans and witch doctors. For over three thousand years, Netheril dominated the North, but even its legendary wizards were unable to stop their final doom.~

@13172 = ~History of the North—Recent History of the North:

In the waning summer months of 1367, an immense orc horde descended from the Spine of the World, intent on winding its way south into the trade lands of the North. This force of orcs, led by King Greneire, surged its way south between the Moonwood and the Cold Wood, stopping just outside the Citadel of Many Arrows.

King Obould, orc ruler of the Citadel of Many Arrows, was terrified at the prospect of another orc horde, despite the fact that he knew they should be working together against the humans of the North and the spawn of Hellgate Keep. His tribal shamans, however, had been predicting a treacherous fall of the citadel—and they'd told the king that he'd be disposed by other orcs.

Thus, it was a dark day when King Greneire and his horde of 150,000 orcs appeared on the plains outside the Citadel of Many Arrows. King Obould announced to his followers that this horde had been sent to dislodge them from their home and send them out to be scavengers among the plains. He vowed that, as Gruumsh as his witness, the Citadel of Many Arrows would slaughter these treacherous orcs "like elves during a festival."

For four months, the forty thousand orcs within the citadel held their ground. Assault after assault was mounted against the high walls of the garrison, but the attacking orcs were losing far more than the defenders. Still, the living conditions within the walls—never too good to begin with—created losses of their own.

The battle for the Citadel of Many Arrows culminated during the first week of Uktar. As another light blanket of snow sought to bury the gathered orcs, King Greneire threw his entire remaining army at the citadel, bursting its gates and pitting orc against orc in a flurry of swords. As the two orc kings sought one another out along the ramparts, the citadel began to burn.

The orcs that survive the battle still speak of the extraordinary prowess of the two kings as they battled one another before their troops. Finally, however, King Obould ran Greneire through with his long sword, but Obould was severely wounded by the time Greneire had breathed his last breath. The orcs erupted into battle once again, and no one is quite certain what became of King Obould.

It was through the smoke and snow that the victors of the conflict emerged: the dwarves of Clan Warcrown along with a contingent of troops from Silverymoon. Charging in through the shattered gates, these new attackers quickly routed the exhausted orcs of the citadel, sending them scurrying off into the wilderness.

King Emerus Warcrown now rules the Citadel of Many Arrows, though the dwarves now call the city by its old name of Felbarr. Most in the North still tend to refer to the city as the Citadel, however, waiting to see if it can withstand the next orc horde. King Warcrown has put out a call for all dwarves to help defend the citadel, and news of a new vein of gold and silver is spreading rapidly through dwarven communities.~

@13175 = ~History of the North—The Might of Men:

Along the coast, in what was once the elven community of Illefarn, humanity was once again rising in power. Merchants from the south, tribesmen from the North, and seafarers from western islands had created a village around a trading post on a deep-water harbor, first known as Nimoar's Hold after the Uthgardt chieftain whose tribe seized and fortified the ramshackle village. Nimoar and his successors, known as War Lords, led the men of Waterdeep (as it had become known to ship captains) in a slowly losing battle against the trolls. In a final, climactic battle, the trolls breached the aging palisade and all seemed lost—until the magic of Ahghairon of Silverymoon turned luck against the trolls, destroying and scattering them.

Ahghairon, heir to the heritage and learning of Netheril, stayed in Waterdeep, and in his 112th year he again saved the city—this time from itself. In so doing, he created the Lords of Waterdeep. The city grew into the greatest in the North, possibly in all Faerûn. With Waterdeep as a firm anchor, civilization forged cautiously into the wilderness. Illuskan (now Luskan) was taken from the orcs. Loudwater, Llorkh, Triboar, Longsaddle, Secomber, and other towns were settled by pioneers from Waterdeep, sponsored by Waterdhavian merchant families.

Though it's been centuries since the last orc invasion, there's still constant strife. Barbarians harass merchants, travelers, and towns, the seas swim with Northmen pirates, and wars have marred the land in recent years. Luskan, now a fierce merchant city known to harbor—and support—pirates, waged a war with the island realm of Ruathym over an act of piracy against one of the few legitimate Luskan merchant ships. The war raged for nearly a year, with Ruathym slowly losing ground. When it appeared Luskan would finally win the naval war and land on the island itself, the Lords' Alliance entered the fray. They threatened war against Luskan if the skirmishes didn't stop immediately. Unable to fight a two-front war efficiently, Luskan canceled its invasion plans.

Tensions between Luskan and Ruathym are still high, and their ships are often seen taking potshots at each other as they pass, often just a wave or two away from each other. The government of Ruathym has recently been sending adventurers into the hills of its island realm, looking for mercenaries who are killing merchants, farmers, and woodsmen. Ruathym believes Luskan still has a presence on the island, trying to win through subversion and terrorism what it could not accomplish through war.

To the far north, the Ten Towns have finished rebuilding after being nearly destroyed by the monstrous forces of Akar Kessel. With help from the tundra barbarians living nearby, they've built and repaired their cities, replanted the sparse foliage, and—most importantly—replenished the morale of their citizens. A recent trader who passed through the area carrying 17 wagons of rare oak lumber said that it was nearly impossible to determine who's a barbarian and who isn't. "They're living together!" he reported in amazement.~

@13176 = ~History of the North—1368, Year of the Banner:

As the dwarves settled in for the winter in their reclaimed city of Felbarr, a group of Zhentarim-sponsored adventurers broke into Great Worm Cavern, slaying Elrem the Wise, shaman leader of the Great Worm tribe. As the tribe's warriors descended into the ranks of the evil adventurers, teleportation magic spirited at least three of those responsible—as well as a vast amount of treasure stolen from Elrem—to safety.

According to Themrin, the tribe's present shaman, Elrem promised to "watch over the tribe in spirit now that my mortal form is destroyed." Despite the reassuring words of Elrem, the tribe suffered through an oppressive winter that included both heavy snow, scarce game, and low morale.

Trusted visitors to the barbarian encampment report that Themrin and Gweshen "Ironhand" Talistars are wearing some form of armor made from the scales of Elrem. This use of their former shaman's body as "protection" was supposedly ordained through a dream vision. The armor appears as little more than a supple leather armor, but seems to deflect blows and protect as well as full plate mail.

Nesme reported a drastic rise in the number of troll attacks in the Evermoors, and various sources confirm that something is driving the trolls out of the moors. Whatever is behind the trolls' exodus is destined to remain a mystery for the remainder of the year, as adventuring parties expend themselves against the never-ending supply of trolls that are fleeing the bog.

In the most surprising move of the year, the Blue Bear Tribe, led by the shaman/chieftain Tanta Hagara, marched on the fiend-ridden fortress of Hellgate Keep. While a brief struggle for political control of the city was reported by various sources, Tanta Hagara emerged as the new ruler of the city.~

@13177 = ~History of the North—1369, Year of the Gauntlet:

The tumultuous climate of Hellgate Keep continued to provide adventuring activity. A group of Harpers infiltrated the city using cloaking magic and revealed that Tanta Hagara was actually an annis. This revelation did nothing to hamper the Blue Bear's respect for their powerful chieftain however, and the city responded to the unmasking by attacking caravans en route to Sundabar. In addition, a few expeditionary forces of tanar'ri were sent to harass the Citadel of the Mists, Sundabar, and Silverymoon. Tanta Hagara informed her "loyal troops" that gates existed in these cities that could allow other tanar'ri to "join us in the glorious battles to come as we take control of all of the North!"

Alustriel cast powerful magical spells in the defense of Silverymoon against the raiding tanar'ri, and the city itself suffered no damage from their attack. The Mistmaster of the Citadel of the Mists likewise aided in the defense of his citadel, though reports still rage about the assistance of the treants of the High Forest.

Sundabar suffered from Hellgate Keep's attack, as the fiends broke through the walls and raised havoc along the city streets. While adventurers battled the fiends, Helm Dwarfriend led a large contingent of the city guard to drive the remainder from Sundabar. Still, the fiends from Hellgate Keep left the city with the satisfaction of knowing that it was burning in their wake. Within two days, however, the fires were extinguished, and Sundabar has since rebuilt from the attack.

By mid Eleasias, rumors that Turlang, the powerful treant who resides in the northern High Forest, was actively defending the woodlands near the Citadel of the Mists reached the ears of Tanta Hagara, the hag-ruler of Hellgate Keep. News that Turlang was aiding the Mistmaster did not escape her notice, and the belief that the Citadel of the Mists was holding an extraplanar artifact only added to the hag's interest.

Tanta assembled a large force consisting of more than one hundred tanar'ri and other fiends as well as five hundred members of the Blue Bear tribe to raze the Citadel of the Mists. But as the evil forces marched their way into the High Forest, the Mistmaster put his own plan into motion. Two Harper agents, a bard named Cryshana Fireglen and a priest of Mystra known as Spellviper, infiltrated Hellgate Keep disguised as members of the Blue Bear tribe. Each carried with them part of an extraplanar artifact called the Gatekeeper's Crystal.

The Gatekeeper's Crystal is an artifact shaped like a three-pointed star that is made of onyx and an unknown metal that entwines itself through the gem. Each point of the star is a separate piece that can be combined together to create the artifact or separated to form three powerful magical items. While the crystal can be used in different manners, it was primarily created to bring down wards, including mythals and other powerful protections. According to legend, it was created by a powerful lich who used it to render clerics powerless, stripping them of their ability to turn undead and nullifying necromantic magic within a 50-mile radius.

The Mistmaster had a different use for the Gatekeeper's Crystal, but he needed volunteers to aid him in placing two shards of the crystal at precise locations within the warded city of Hellgate Keep. In particular, he needed two people who would be willing to trade their lives to exterminate the fiends of Hellgate Keep forever. Spellviper and Cryshana agreed to the suicide mission. Holding the pieces of the crystal, the two Harpers waited for the Mistmaster to activate the magic with his third piece, initiating the magic that would tear Hellgate Keep asunder. When a blazing beam of purple energy illuminated the skies over the keep, no one within the fiend's stronghold had time to wonder what was happening.

The power of the Gatekeeper's Crystal forced the wards to cascade upon the city, causing an implosion that shook the ground for more than one hundred miles. As quickly as the wards surrounding Hellgate Keep collapsed, the crystal released the magical energy in an explosion that leveled every building in the city, leaving nothing but fist-sized chunks of rocks where Hellgate Keep once stood. Not a living creature stirred in the remains; all was silent and lifeless.

The force of tanar'ri from Hellgate Keep was unsure what had happened but had felt the tremor when the Gatekeeper's Crystal had been activated. They were fighting for their own lives, however, as the treants, korred, centaurs, satyrs, dryads, and other creatures of the High Forest—including defenders of the Citadel of the Mists—battered them into the moist earth. One of the North's most notable rulers fell in the battle, however, but he took at least six tanar'ri with him to his grave. Faurael Blackhammer, the lord protector of Triboar, fell alongside his troops near the conclusion of the conflict.

Within weeks after the final battle with Hellgate Keep, treants blocked passage farther north at the joining of the Heart-blood and Delimbiyr rivers. While the treants care little for hunters and adventurers passing through the area, all caravans seeking passage north to Sundabar have been repulsed—and this is not a matter that the treants wish to negotiate.

In another mishap blamed on Turlang, Turnstone Pass was blocked by a tremendous avalanche. This final calamity sealed the Upvale from any major force of men. Travel into the area formerly occupied by Hellgate Keep is now limited to adventurers and other brave travelers.

The Mistmaster has been questioned repeatedly by some of the most powerful wizards in the realms, including Elminster of Shadowdale and Khelben Arunsun, about the current location of the Gatekeeper's Crystal. Most sources claim that the pieces of the crystal have been scattered amongst the planes again, but no one is certain.

Near Nesme, the source of the trolls' exodus is revealed. Fog and cloud giants have taken up residence in the moor, driving the trolls from the giants' new "homeland." While it's unknown how many giants have taken up residence in the High Moor, estimates range up to several hundred. A thick mist continually hangs in the air of the Evermoors now, even more persistent and thick than the mist before the giants' arrival. Many believe that these new mists are the work of the cloud giants, but none can be certain.

Alustriel of Silverymoon sent a detachment of guards to investigate the eastern borders of the moor, and the guards returned with news that a gathering of around twenty fog giants who were "of good nature and quite friendly" had taken up residence in a formerly troll-infested area.

Guards from neighboring Nesme were not so fortunate, however, running into a clan of violent, boulder-hurling fog and cloud giants who nearly decimated their unit. In addition, a group of adventurers crawled into Nesme with terrible burns, reporting that they had run into a black dragon at a fog giant encampment. Overall, it appears that both good and evil giants now call the moor their home.~

Even before spring has graced the Savage North, reports of treants massing in the High Forest have reached all of the northern cities. It seems that all of the creatures of the forest have mobilized to restore the High Forest after the fall of Hellgate Keep. Something must still reside below the ruins of Hellgate Keep, however, for the Company of the Jaded Heart never emerged from the depths below the city. The treants have since blocked entrance into the ruins, sealing whatever evil still lurks within far below the sight of man.

But there is other activity in the North as well. Luskan still flirts with war, tempting neighboring cities and yet staying just below the wrath of Waterdeep. The barbarians still brew in the north, quick to take offense at innocent incursions into their sacred holdings. Rumors of Zhentarim agents scouring the Fallen Lands for powerful magic from long-lost Netheril continue to circulate. And adventurers still abound in the Savage Frontier.~

One of the few long-standing mercenary companies that operate in Cormyr, the Red Ravens have a strength on paper of 110 swords, but can easily triple that number with new hires if they get a sufficiently large contract. They have been kept on retainer by the government of Cormyr with the stated purpose of cleaning out the Stonelands to the north. They have been moderately successful in this goal, but the Stonelands are still far from being a safe territory.

The Red Ravens are commanded by Rayanna the Rose, a veteran of the Horde crusade. They are noted for their honesty and trustworthiness, as they do not wish to jeopardize their royal charter. Most of their troops are armed with studded leather and carry long swords. They charge 200 gold pieces per week for the services of their 110-being unit. Their symbol is a red raven amulet.~

@13182 = ~History of the Unicorn Run:

Bards and sages pass down the tale that the headwaters of the Unicorn Run are, in truth, the Font of Life and a cradle of fecundity. Each natural race is said to have emerged from the womb of Chauntea onto Toril at the river's source and then traveled down the Unicorn Run to the outside world. Some say that a daughter of Chauntea resides at the river's source to usher the newborns into the world, while others claim that Shialla midwifes the process.

Regardless of the truth, the elves, korreds, and halflings all agree that the Unicorn Run is sacred to life and a site of incredible purity. As a result, all three races have strong taboos about extended trips up the run, for if the river is ever fouled, then no new races will ever be born on Toril again.~

It is said that even the powers must cavort and amuse themselves once in a great while. Far to the north of the Spine of the World is the Valley of the Gods. A paradise unequaled on this world or in the planes, this playground of the gods is not meant for mortals. Any mortal who reaches the Valley becomes a deity, for only deities may exist in the Valley. Far too many mortals with delusions of grandeur have thrown away the pleasures of this side of the Spine and their kingdoms in this world, only to break their backs searching for the legendary Valley of the Gods.~

@13184 = ~History of the Vast:

Two millennia ago the Vast was Vastar, the orcish lands. These were the breeding grounds of the goblin hordes that would spill eastward and cross the Dragon Reach in ramshackle boats to raid the elves. The orcs were overthrown by invading dwarves, who established the Realm of the Glimmering Swords. It was during this time that the first humans came to the Vast, including the mage Maskyr.

The rule of the dwarves occurred against a backdrop of constant war with the orcs, such that there were perhaps only 40 years of true peace for the Realm of the Glimmering Swords. The dwarves were overrun by the orcs, and they escaped extinction only through the aid of human and elven allies. The remaining dwarves left the region to the newly arriving humans and retreated to the east, to the south, and to isolated and hidden communities within the Vast.

The most successful of the humans were the adventurers whose hunger was sated by gold and whose thirst was slaked by great deeds. This was the Time of the Glorious Fools, and there are those who will argue that it is still that age, as adventurers still rule the cities of Calaunt and Ravens Bluff. The orcs today are contained, if not conquered, and trade has grown up in the lands of the Vast. However, for many individuals with adventuring blood, it is still a wilderness in which one may prove one's worth.~

@13185 = ~History of the Western Heartlands:

The history of the Western Heartlands is a history of endless battles and destroyed empires. In ancient times, these were the lands of the Fallen Kingdom of Illefarn, the Lost Kingdom of Man, and rumored Netheril. In more recent history, the land has been fertilized with blood and bone as forces from the Empires of the Sands surged northward, the evil peoples within Dragonspear and the Goblin Marches spilled forth, and mercenary companies moved to and fro in the service of one petty warlord after another. Recent battles leveled the Way Inn and threatened Daggerford. Even the Time of Troubles did not leave this desolate land unmarked—Bhaal himself perished at Boareskyr Bridge, and the waters it passes over have remained poisoned to this day.

The cities of the Western Heartlands are strong, independent, and varied. They are also strongly motivated by trade and listen harder to the ringing of gold than the call of battle. But something else prospers in the open land—freedom and opportunity. No nation lays claim on the Western Heartlands to land beyond that which their armies can control, and no warlord can make demands beyond the swing of his axe. Small holds and castles regularly spring up, only to be knocked down by invading forces or abandoned after a generation or two. Lost dungeons and secret citadels lie scattered throughout the land, and this rugged frontier presents more than enough opportunities for adventurers.~

@13186 = ~History of the Zhentarim, Two Zhents' Worth:

Much confusion exists in the realms regarding Zhentil Keep and the (not-so) secret society known as the Black Network or Zhentarim. The two are closely tied, such that a speaker may refer to one when meaning the other and still be clearly understood. In general, both mean trouble.

Zhentil Keep is a walled, independent city on the western shores of the Moonsea. It is one of the most evil cities in the realms, a blight on the North, and a haven for Evil groups, plotting manipulators, dark religions, and foul practices. Its rulers seek to dominate the lands around it, including the Dragonspine Mountains, Yulash, Voonlar, and the neighboring Dales. The city of Zhentil Keep and its armies (known as the Zhentilar, to make matters more confusing) have destroyed Teshendale, come close to destroying Daggerdale, and for a long time had an agent ruling Shadowdale.

The Zhentarim is an organization of evil priests, wizards, and inhuman creatures bent on controlling all the trade and power between the Sword Coast (meaning Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep) and the Moonsea (including the intervening lands of Cormyr and Anauroch). Its aims in the Moonsea area are the same as Zhentil Keep's, and the two factions work hand-in-glove, often sharing the same membership. The Zhentarim have a more far-reaching effect than Zhentil Keep, though, and have agents throughout the North.

In addition, the Zhentarim are not limited to Zhentil Keep itself, and maintain a number of fortified outposts. Their rulership has spread with the passing years. In addition to being the dominant force in Zhentil Keep, the Zhentarim control the Citadel of the Raven and Darkhold, two important castle complexes. Over the years, more power has been moving away from Zhentil Keep (filled with a lot of unknown and untrustworthy flunkies) and into these more secure areas.

Within the Dalelands area, Zhentarim smells of Zhentil Keep and vice versa, but in reality not every Keeper (yet another name for a native of Zhentil Keep) is of the Black Network, and not every agent of the Zhentarim is from Zhentil Keep. Adventurers should watch who they trust as a result.~

@13187 = ~History of Ulgarth:

Ulgarth was settled by the great empire of Raurin, in the height of its power. When the empire was destroyed, it endured centuries of barbarism. Warchiefs united the country several times during this period. They fought many skirmishes with other barbarians, particularly those in Durpar and Var the Golden. In 202 DR, the barbarian tribes were nearly wiped out by the forces of Mulhorand.

In 348 DR, a group of outlaws, fleeing the justice of the priest-kings of Mulhorand, came to Ulgarth. There they found a fertile, almost unoccupied land. They settled down, and began raising children and crops. This new society in Ulgarth gradually grew in power, while its neighbors grew apace. But while Durpar grew as a result of its commerce and its philosophy of balance, Ulgarth concentrated on agrarian pursuits. The Ulgarthians developed a highly structured caste system of lords and peasants. In 1002 DR, the centuries' long skirmishes between Durpar and Ulgarth came to an end, as the two countries finally reached a balance of power. There were too many centuries of warfare between the countries for them to completely trust each other. With their mutual border well defended on both sides, both countries have given up on the idea of conquering the other.

Trade between the Ulgarth and the Shining Lands has become a vital factor to both nations. Ulgarth produces many of the items that Durparians trade throughout the world. In return, Durpar trades many exotic items to Ulgarth. Of course, the Durparian merchants usually get the better of any trade. The current king, Drasna the Fortunate, has continued his predecessor's policy of non-aggression with the Durparians.~

@13188 = ~History of Waterdeep:

Waterdeep was used as a trading site for trade activities between northern tribesmen and southern merchants more than two millennia ago. By 1,000 years ago, permanent farms had sprung up in the area. The first mention of a Waterdeep (not as a city, but as a collection of warlords) occurs only 400 years ago. The city was truly established as a going concern by 1032 DR, the year Ahghairon became the first Lord of Waterdeep, and the date from which Northreckoning is counted. The city grew spectacularly, such that by 1248 DR both the City of the Dead and the guilds had been developed. The guildmasters seized control soon afterwards, ushering in a period of unrest and bitter conflict known as the Guildwars. The Guildwars ended only when the two surviving guildmasters brought in their own period of misrule. It was only in 1273 DR that the present system of government (or lack thereof) was instituted. This was the year that the Magisters were established and the secret Lords of Waterdeep were firmly reestablished. Since that time, the city has continued to grow and prosper. Humankind and other races come from all over the realms to earn hard coin in the City of Splendors. Over the years these successful merchants have set up guilds and themselves become nobility, supporting the secretive Lords of Waterdeep who police the city fairly, yet with a light hand, by means of the superb city guard (soldiers), city watch (police), and over 20 black-robed magistrates. As a result, Waterdeep is a place tolerant of different races, religions, and lifestyles. This in turn has encouraged commerce, and Waterdeep has grown into a huge, eclectic city.~

@13189 = ~History of Waterdeep—Age 0, Tuabemoots and Pioneers:

Few now know the true history of this great city, which had its beginnings over a thousand years ago, when the North was truly what Southerners still sneeringly call it: "the Savage North." In those days, most of the North was covered with vast, tall forests of ancient green, and inhabited by dwarves and goblinkind (in the most northern mountains and foothills) and elves (in widely scattered forest enclaves everywhere else). A few primitive human tribes lived along the Sword Coast, fishing, hunting and gathering in spring and fall to trade their furs with vessels sailing in from the south for merchant's jewelry, metal tools, and the occasionally-available weapon or two. In the spring, these vessels came primarily to cut and take huge trees for shipbuilding, trees being no longer available in such large sizes farther south.

In the fall, the vessels came in to cut timber for their own repairs, or to take on a cargo of wood if the misfortunes of trading had left their holds low or empty. Most of these trademoots were at a certain place where there was a great natural deepwater harbor, protected from the sea by a rocky spur of land, an arm of an isolated coastal crag, or a rocky island beyond it.~

@13190 = ~History of Waterdeep—Age I, The Rise of the Warlords:

Over the years, the forest was cut back farther and farther from the shore, and tribes began to stay most of the year there, farming the cleared land. The wiser among them claimed and controlled some of the timber in order to trade for more weaponry and tools. Such claims angered many who found the squatters rich from frequent trade, and brought attacks from land and sea, the more warlike tribes slaughtering the more sedentary settlers. Noted among these tribes was that led by Nimoar, a chieftain who ordered his people to seize the farms, crude wooden docks, trading sheds, and storage barns built up around the bay. They settled there themselves, and erected a log palisade within an earthen embankment to protect the holdings. After several abortive pirate and tribal raids, Nimoar's people thrived in their new home, a fledgling town referred to as "the town of Water-deep."

Farther north, orc tribes had outgrown their mountain strongholds. Attempts to expand underground met with fierce dwarven resistance (although many small gnomish colonies were overwhelmed and wiped out), and the orcs spread out on the surface of the land, coming south and down out of the mountains, hurling their seemingly endless numbers against all who stood in their path. Here and there elven enclaves held out, but the push southward displaced many other northern inhabitants, including the "everlasting ones" (trolls), who came down into the newly-cleared lands northeast of Nimoar's Hold, those lands now known as the Trollmoors. Nimoar died of old age during this time of increasing danger. Younger War Lords led the men of Waterdeep (for so the ship-captains called the harbor) in battles against the trolls. There were many bloody struggles between men and trolls for a decade, until the magic of a Northem youth named Ahghairon turned the fortunes of war against the trolls, and the "everlasting ones" were destroyed or scattered. Ahghairon rose slowly in skill and power with the passage of years, until he became a great mage. He discovered a supply of potions of longevity (or learned the art of making such), for he lived on, still physically a man in his prime, for decade upon decade.

Fearing further attacks, the men of Waterdeep raised a small keep on the slopes of Mount Waterdeep above their farms, where fire arrows from on high could defend against attacking trolls. Many outlying tribes who had come to the settlement for safety from the trolls stayed, and expanded the walls with new farms several times. War Lords ruled the Free City of Waterdeep, holding it independent and increasingly wealthy as years passed.~

@13191 = ~History of Waterdeep—Age III, The Bloody Reign of the Guildmasters:

There was great turmoil in the City as the Guildmasters argued amongst themselves as to who should govern the City, and more than one merchant of power was found murdered. Groups of liveried bodyguards appeared openly armed on the streets, accompanying their masters, and two very troubled months passed as they bickered and parleyed (and occasionally dueled in the streets). At last, they decided that all Masters should rule Waterdeep together, in a council. The lesser nobles and many townsfolk protested, saying that the Lords ruled by right and by the people's consent. The Guildmasters, however, said that the Lords had not been seen since Ahghairon's death, and that they must have been golems or zombies, controlled by Ahghairon to conceal his lone rule—and indeed, the Lords were silent and unseen, and continued to be so.

In truth, the Lords were real men and women whose identities had been compromised, over the years, by certain curious Guildmasters who had ordered them slain by their own closemouthed, loyal servants following Ahghairon's death. The only Lords still surviving (those who had remained secret) were Baeron, a woodworker, and Shilam, an apprentice wizard. These surviving Lords kept very quiet, and waited. The Guildmasters thought all the living Lords of the City had been eliminated, and took firm rule over Waterdeep.

The Guildmasters ruled Waterdeep for only six years ere their self-interested squabbling led to bloodshed. Open quarrels and a few murders quickly erupted into a brief but vicious series of street fights and midnight attacks. This strife, oftimes termed "the Guildwars" by sages (although it was never as long-drawn-out or so formal as to be called a "war" when it was taking place), left all but two Guildmasters dead, most of the City's best minds stilled, and much of the City's gold wasted or plundered with the Guilds in disarray.

The surviving Guildmasters were Lhorar Gildeggh of the Shipwrights and Ehlemm Zoar of the Gemcutters. These two—ruthless manipulators both—were well-matched and could not overcome each other, though their private armies clashed often in the streets. At length, they sickened of bloodshed, after many from both families were dead in the gutters, and agreed to rule together. Two thrones were set up in Castle Waterdeep, and from then the two argued bitterly over this and that, and the City was a place of tension and fear. All matters, including the recognition of new Guildmasters to rule the "headless" guilds, had to come before the Two Lords Magister, as Lhorar and Ehlemm were called. Few matters were settled.~

@13192 = ~History of Waterdeep—Age II, The Lords' Rule Begins:

In his 112th winter, Ahghairon had a sharp disagreement with Raurlor, who was then Warlord of Waterdeep. Raurlor wanted to use Waterdeep's acquired wealth and strength-of-arms to create a Northern empire, with Waterdeep its capital (and Raurlor its ruler), and gathered armies for the purpose. Ahghairon defied him before all the people, and Raurlor ordered the mage to be chained. Ahghairon magically struck aside all who sought to lay hands on him. In a fury Raurlor struck at the mage with his own blade. Ahghairon rose into the air, just out of reach, and, as the infuriated Warlord slashed repeatedly at his rising feet, gestured. Raurlor's blade transmuted in his hand, from steel into a hissing serpent, which promptly bit him. The Warlord died of the venom before the shocked people assembled there. Ahghairon then gathered all the captains of Waterdeep's army, and all the seniors of the families of Waterdeep. While runners sought to bring them to the Castle, flames roared and crackled in the Warlord's empty chair-of-state at Ahghairon's bidding, so that no one sat there. Then at a gesture from the mage, the flames were gone as though they had never been, leaving the chair unmarked. Ahghairon seated himself, then, and proclaimed himself the first Lord of Waterdeep, saying that henceforth wisdom and not armed might would rule in the city. He would gather some few—in secret—to rule as Lords with him, masked and disguised when they appeared to the people, but equal to him in authority and free of coercion by any, himself included. These Lords were to be drawn from all walks of life in the city, and could serve as long as they wished.

The people heard, and agreed, and for the next two hundred years, Ahghairon ruled Waterdeep with his unknown fellow Lords. Over the years, the masked Lords were a group of sometimes five, six, or seven, who appeared seldom and said little. Some whispered that they were Ahghairon's servants, or even magical automatons controlled by the Old Mage. Still, Ahghairon's justice was swift and fair, his laws good, his guardsmen polite and just as ready to help as apprehend, and the people approved. The years passed in peace and prosperity. The North was opened to humans. Roads built under Ahghairon's direction linked it together, from the ruins of "the Fallen Kingdom," which had been shattered by goblin races' attacks before men were numerous in the North, to the cities that would later become Amn. Waterdeep grew fivefold in size and wealth. From all over the realms, folk began to come to the "Crown of the North," drawn by money—and among them came those who rob, cheat, and steal. When word of doings extending beyond simple theft to deception-in-workmanship and the appearance of many fly-by-night impostor craftsmen reached Ahghairon's ears, he called together the senior merchants, "the Noble Ones," and suggested that they form guilds as was done in the far South to police the unscrupulous of their own professions. Some resisted, or were furious, but most saw the advantages of such an arrangement, particularly if they were free to set matters up themselves, and not have less favorable arrangements forced upon them. The Guilds were created forthwith. Twice more the city walls were expanded, as Waterdeep continued to grow in size and prosperity. Its merchants traveled the world over, bringing back exotic goods from afar, and spreading word of the city's wealth to remote lands. In the South, some listened with an eye to conquest or at least plunder, but swords were already out in those southern lands in a time of widespread strife, and no invaders came.

Ahghairon's health eventually failed and he died. He was buried with ceremony in his tower, which was secured against thieves and fools. Those who learned the arts arcane from the Old Mage cast the most potent protective magics known upon his home and resting-place (which, many believe, remains inviolate today).~

@13193 = ~History of Waterdeep—Age lV, The Return of the Lords:

One day to the Courts of the Lord Magister came two people masked and robed as the Lords of Waterdeep of old. Where they came from no one knew, but they appeared in the Castle's Great Hall where the Courts were, and commanded the Lords Magister to leave the city forthwith. Laughing, the Lords Magister refused, whereupon the shorter of the masked intruders (the lady Shilam, apprentice to Ahghairon and his undeclared heir as first Lord of the City) blasted them with lightning and fire, and their very thrones were shattered and toppled.

The taller of the two intruders (Baeron) then called for the heads of the noble houses to come to them, or leave the city forthwith and forever, if they cared not to come by nightfall. All in the Courts heard, and the news was cried in the streets.

The surviving nobles came, reluctantly and with bodyguards, expecting such a summons to be a trap. Baeron spoke to them and the crowd of curious townsfolk that had also come, saying, "this must not happen again." If Waterdeep was to be safe once more, he told them, all must support what he and his fellow Lord now planned, as they had supported Ahghairon in the past. The two would choose others to be Lords as before, he said, and they would rule in secret, as before—save for himself. He removed his mask, and said, "I am Baeron. I would be Lord as Ahghairon was before. I would be safe in this my city again." And the folk of Waterdeep there agreed. Shilarn, still masked, commanded that the houses of the Two Lords Magister be Outcast. There was protest, and she raised her hands that had blasted the thrones, and it was still again. And the house of Gildeggh and of Zoar were outcast.

Peace returned to the city, and Waterdhavians to their labors. To inhibit discovery of who the Lords were, Baeron selected certain men of character whom he knew well, and appointed them Magisters ("Black Robes," they were soon called, from their robes of office) under the Lords, to judge and apply the laws of Waterdeep in daily affairs. These Magisters he paid well, to raise them from temptation, and gave lodgings to those who feared for safety to dwell among the people. To so serve, he told the city, was a burden, not a proud misuse of authority, and if any wished to no longer serve, or were found wanting, they were not to be vilified, but accorded respect. And over the Magisters the Lords sat in their Court, to correct and overrule the judgments of the Magisters. Baeron told the people that none were to decry or belittle any judgments of Magisters that the Lord saw fit to alter or cast aside. If any thought ill of the offices or those who held them they could turn back to the rule of sword and whim, and perish as had those before them. Before the Lord's Court Baeron encouraged people to speak freely for the length of a short candle's burning, without fear of chastisement or reproach from the Lords for anything said, as long as they spoke openly and answered questions or opposing views put to them by any there. Thus, he held, just grievances of folk would be heard, no matter how small the matter or lowly the speaker. And so it was. Slow to take hold, until people knew it for careful justice, but enduring beyond Baeron's time, and beyond Shilarn's time, and beyond the time of their daughter Lhestyn "The Masked Lady," who wed Zelphar Arunsun of Neverwinter, and was mother to Khelben "Blackstaff' Arunsun, a Lord of Waterdeep today, who knows the secrets of long years as Ahghairon did. And as the years have passed, Waterdeep has grown in size and variety, flourishing with good trade under the tolerance and protection of strong defenders and good government. The years passed not without troubles, varying from the Godswar (when Waterdeep played host to gods dying and ascending) to such occurrences as a green dragon assailing the Field of Triumph (part of a plot by the Knights of the Shield to overthrow the Lords' Rule), but the city and her peoples survived and prevailed against all strife. The Lords' Alliance provides continued safety for all the settlements of the northern Sword Coast and those inland, with Waterdeep as the heart of the alliance. Though it can be matched in size or commerce, there is no city the realms over that compares to the sheer variety of life and experiences found in fair Waterdeep, Crown of the North.~

All creatures within the area of effect take 3d6 points of damage and must save vs. Spell or be blinded for 1 turn. Undead that are hit by the sunray take 1d6 damage per level of the caster, and must save vs. Spell or be destroyed.~

Saving Throw: None

Upon casting a Conjure Earth Elemental spell, the caster opens a special gate to the Elemental Plane of Earth, and an earth elemental is summoned in the vicinity of the caster. There is a 60% chance that a 12-Hit-Dice elemental appears, a 35% chance that a 16-Hit-Dice elemental appears, and a 5% chance that a 24-Hit-Dice elemental appears.

The carrion crawler is a scavenger of subterranean areas, feeding primarily upon carrion. However, when such food becomes scarce or when it is threatened, it will attack and kill living creatures.

The carrion crawler looks like a cross between a giant green cutworm and a cephalopod. Like so many other hybrid monsters, the carrion crawler may well be the result of genetic experimentation by a mad, evil wizard.

The monster's head is covered with a tough hide, but the body is not well protected. The monster is accompanied by a rank, fetid odor which often gives warning of its approach.~

They come screaming, jabbering, and howling out of the night. Dozens, maybe hundreds, of hunchbacked, naked humanoids swarm unceasingly forward. They have no thought of safety, subtlety, or strategy, leaving others with no hope of stopping their mass assault. Then, having come and killed, the gibberlings move on, seemingly randomly, back into the night.

The first impression of gibberlings is of a writhing mass of fur and flesh in the distant moonlit darkness. The pandemonium is actually a mass of pale, hunchbacked humanoids, with pointed canine ears and black manes surrounding their hideous, grinning faces. Their black eyes shine with a maniacal gleam.~

@15996 = ~Hobgoblin
Hobgoblins are a fierce humanoid race that wage perpetual war with the other humanoid races. They are intelligent, organized, and aggressive.

The typical hobgoblin is a burly humanoid standing at least six feet tall. Their hairy hides range from dark reddish-brown to dark gray. Their faces show dark red or red-orange skin. Large males have blue or red noses. Hobgoblin eyes are either yellowish or dark brown while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to be brightly colored, often bold, blood red. Any leather is always tinted black. Hobgoblin weaponry is kept polished and repaired.

Hobgoblins have their own language and often speak with orcs, goblins, and carnivorous apes.~

@15997 = ~Kobold
Kobolds are a cowardly, sadistic race of short humanoids that vigorously contest the human and demihuman races for living space and food. They especially dislike gnomes and attack them on sight.

Barely clearing three feet in height, kobolds have scaly hides that range from dark, rusty brown to a rusty black. They smell of damp dogs and stagnant water. Their eyes glow like a pair of bright red sparks, and they have two small horns ranging from tan to white. Because of the kobold fondness for wearing raggedy garb of red and orange, their non-prehensile rat-like tails, and their language (which sounds like small dogs yapping), these fell creatures are often not taken seriously. This is often a fatal mistake, for what they lack in size and strength they make up in ferocity and tenacity.~

The authors and advocates of such tomes claim that, by drawing on the most recent theories in sociology and interpersonal psychology, it is possible to raise an individual's Charisma by a single point. In truth, such increases in personal charisma are the product of magical spells placed on the text as it is in the writing process. These same spells also cause the tome to disappear after their first use. An excellent marketing strategy, you must concede...

By means of this spell, the caster calls an outer-planar creature—the pit fiend—to attack <PRO_HISHER> foes as well as <PRO_HIMHER>self, if <PRO_HESHE>'s not careful. The caster must use a Protection From Evil spell on <PRO_HIMHER>self (and comrades) to keep the devil from noticing <PRO_HIMHER>. If the caster fails to protect <PRO_HIMHER>self in this manner, the pit fiend will tear the caster and <PRO_HISHER> companions apart piece by piece, then feast on the remains.~

Dispel Magic will not free creatures trapped in this manner. There is no Saving Throw.~

Bodhi agreed to fulfill our bargain, though there were some additional concerns she revealed.

According to Bodhi, Irenicus captured me because he had discovered my nature as a child of Bhaal, and he was attempting to "aid" my development, though his methods were indistinguishable from torture. The Shadow Thieves attacked Irenicus before I could be told any of this, and I escaped as he was incarcerated.

Bodhi also told me that she is essentially Irenicus's sister, and that her reason for helping me is that she wishes to free the wizard from the same place that Imoen has been sent to, a dread asylum for magic-users called Spellhold. Bodhi does this not out of any familial attachment, but rather because she requires Irenicus for her own purposes. As added incentive, she offers to reveal whatever Irenicus learned about me.

The asylum is on an island under its own rule, and Bodhi used the gold I gave her to book passage for me. There, I will try to find a way into Spellhold to free Imoen... and, Bodhi hopes, free Irenicus at the same time.~

(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 4
Range: 50 ft.
Duration: 9 rounds + 1 round/level after 7th
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast, the wizard can disturb the emotional state of those around <PRO_HIMHER>. The effect of this is to inflict a feeling of hopelessness upon the enemies within the visual range of the caster. Upon a failed Saving Throw vs. Spell, the affected creature will lie down where they stand and give over all their will to a higher power. Sometimes they can be heard to exclaim things such as "I lay down and die," or "I'm going home." This will last for the duration of the spell, upon which they will return to normal.

The secondary effect of this spell is to instill upon the caster the feeling of courage. This will remove any effects of panic and restore <PRO_HISHER> morale, as well as prevent the above from creeping forth into <PRO_HISHER> psyche. There is no Saving Throw vs. this and it will last for the duration of the spell. It will, however, be affected by Magic Resistance and other such things.~

(Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

The Polymorph Other spell is a powerful magic that permanently alters the form of the creature affected. Mental attributes are not affected, and the target does not receive the special abilities of the new form. However all physical attributes are changed to adhere to the new form. This is a specific version of the spell in that the recipient will be transformed into a squirrel unless a Save vs. Petrification/Polymorph is made successfully. The transformation is instant and permanent until a Dispel Magic is cast successfully upon the affected creature. The natural attacks of the new form also become available and all clothes and equipment that the target was wearing will mold into the new form.~

Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

When cast upon a subject, the subject must make a Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -2 penalty in order to avoid the priest entering <PRO_HISHER> mind. The effects of this spell are similar to those of the wizard spell Domination, with a few minor differences. Most notably, this spell gives the priest no access to the subject's thoughts, memory, or sensory apparatus. The priest simply is able to command the subject to perform certain tasks or functions during the spell's duration. To control the subject, the priest must be within range and must be able to see the subject. This control will last until dispelled or for the duration of the spell.~

(Abjuration)

Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 10-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, all allied creatures within a 10-ft. radius are affected individually by Protection From Evil. It creates a magical barrier around the recipients at a distance of one foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has two major effects: First, all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures against the protected creature receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll. Second, summoned demons cannot target protected creatures.~

(Alteration)

Level: 5
Sphere: Law
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spells is cast, the priest effectively draws on the strength of <PRO_HISHER> god and lends it to the target creature, in effect creating a champion. The target gains a bonus to <PRO_HISHER> THAC0 at a rate of 1 for every 3 levels of the caster. So a 9th level priest would confer a THAC0 bonus of 3 to the target, and so on. Also the target's Strength is set to 18/00 for the duration of the spell and receives all the bonuses to hit and damage rolls that this Strength confers. Note also that if the target's strength is above 18/00, it will actually be reduced to this value.

The drawback to this is that the priest must concentrate on the connection between the target and <PRO_HISHER> god for the duration of the spell, hence losing the ability to cast any spells during this time. The effect lasts for 3 rounds for every level of the caster or until dispelled.~

Chaotic Commands renders a creature immune to magical commands. Suggestion, Charm, Domination, Command, Sleep, Maze, and Confusion are all spells that fit into this category.

Formerly

"A Lovely Bun-cake Brightens Anyone's Day"

The recipes herein are mine own imagining, and thus ingredients are subject to change as per my whim.
************
Belladonna Bun-cake
A simple little dish for a rainy afternoon.

Cornflour,
The eggs of a seabird,
A spoon of the Whitecap fungus,
The fruit of your choice for sweetening,
One small measure of the belladonna root.
Prepare as one would a breadloaf, though less time given to the rising.
Bake in a well-stoked hearth under leaves for one turn of the hourglass.

Notes to myself: Refrain from eating this ever again. Exceptionally poisonous. Remember the unfortunate week on the kitchen floor.
************
Dradeel's Vegetable Surprise
A dish that turned out surprisingly edible. Not recommended as the primary meal every day for 300 years. Some disorientation may result.

Place 2 cups of virgin Netherese olive oil and 1 large chopped onion in a large pot.
Saute onions in oil over medium fire until onions begin to become clear.
Add 2 chopped carrots and 2 chopped stalks of celery.
Saute for an additional 3 minutes.
Add 1 1/2 quarts of water and bring to a boil.

Add 2 diced and peeled potatoes, 1 cup of white wine (I find that a Myth Rhynnian vintage is perfect), 1 bay leaf, 2 diced tomatoes, and chopped parsley to taste.

Cook, covered, over medium-smallish fire until vegetables are almost tender. Add 2 cups of chopped spinach and cook for an additional 15 minutes. Serve hot and garnish with grated cheese.

Note: For orcish version, replace all ingredients with turnips.

Curative Ingredients for the Dispelling of Lycanthropy.
Mother's family recipe

Notes: Mother's topical salve is a rather large failure. Research further with the following in mind: The creatures on this isle are unusual beyond their splitting into two factions. Theirs is an odd curse, one that defies the traditional remedies (such as the unfortunately dangerous muffins previous), though one is not without hope. The exotic origin of the original stock suggest a unique enchantment, not unlike that of the more widely known vampiric afflictions. The casual bite might be averted using such things as the belladonna flower, but an intentional infection could actually require the extermination of the leader of the clan. This is merely conjecture of course, as I have been unable to examine said leader. Despite my strange immunity, his is a strength that could still inflict a measure of serious damage upon my physical form. He and I have spoken on occasion, though his tolerance of me is no more resilient than mine is of him.

Further notes to myself: Future offerings of peace to either of the wolven clans should not take the form of muffins of any sort.

Advantages:
– May cast Dispel Magic once per day. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 4 levels thereafter. The spell is cast at Speed Factor 1 and acts at twice the Inquisitor's character level.
– May cast True Sight once per day. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 4 levels thereafter.

– +1 bonus to hit and damage rolls.
– The Skald's song is different from the typical Bard's and varies with level:
 1st level: Grants allies a +2 bonus to hit and damage rolls, and a +2 bonus to AC.
 15th level: Grants allies a +4 bonus to hit and damage rolls, a +4 bonus to AC, and immunity to fear.
 20th level: Grants allies a +4 bonus to hit and damage rolls, a +4 bonus to AC, and immunity to fear, stun, and confusion.

(Abjuration)

Level: 1
Sphere: Protection
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

The caster of the Armor of Faith receives significant protection against melee and magical attacks. This magical armor is a force of energy that absorbs a portion of the damage intended for the caster. At 1st level, the protection is 5%, and every 5 levels of the caster improves this by another 5%: For example, a 20th-level priest would have 25% of <PRO_HISHER> damage "absorbed" if protected by this spell.~

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons forth a nymph to assist the party. The nymph has several priest spells at her disposal and will use them in the best interests of the party (these include Mental Domination, Confusion, and Mass Cure). She will remain under the caster's control until slain or the spell's duration expires.~

(Divination)

Level: 5
Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 120-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, an area roughly 120 ft. in radius around the caster will be affected. Instantly and once each round for 1 turn after this spell is cast, all hostile Illusion/Phantasm spells in the area of effect will be dispelled. The spells that are affected by this are Reflected Image, Invisibility, Mirror Image, Non-Detection, Improved Invisibility, Shadow Door, Mislead, Project Image, and Simulacrum. The area of effect is roughly a 120-ft. radius around the caster. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not come into effect with this spell. This spell only affects enemies; thus, it is unable to dispel the invisibility from a party member.~

Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 9

This spell summons an Aerial Servant to do the caster's bidding for the duration of the spell. The servant will attack any enemies that the caster decides, staying until the duration of the spell expires or it is slain.~

Level: 6
Sphere: Guardian, Creation
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

The priest employs this spell to set up a wall of circling, razor-sharp blades. These whirl and flash around the caster, creating an impenetrable barrier. Any creature attempting to pass through the Blade Barrier suffers 8d8 points of damage. Creatures within the area of the barrier when it is invoked are entitled to a Saving Throw vs. Spell to negate the damage. The barrier remains for 1 turn.~

@25751 = ~Creeping Doom
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 7
Sphere: Animal, Summoning
Range: 240 ft.
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

When the caster utters the spell Creeping Doom, <PRO_HESHE> calls forth a mass of venomous, biting and stinging arachnids, insects, and myriapods. This carpetlike mass swarms over a large area, spreading to all enemy creatures within 30 ft. of the target. Those trapped by the insects suffer 2 points of damage each second and a spell failure rate of 100%. For each round the victim remains inside the cloud, <PRO_HESHE> must make a Save vs. Spell at -2 or run away in fear for one round. The advantage of Creeping Doom over its 5th-level counterpart Insect Plague is that it does twice as much damage in half the amount of time.~

@25876 = ~Stoneskin
(Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When a wizard casts this powerful spell upon <PRO_HIMHER>self, an outer skin of stone will move up from the ground, completely covering <PRO_HIMHER>. This skin is of course magical and will hinder the wizard in no way. The effect of this is to protect the wizard from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. For every 2 levels of the caster, an additional skin is gained upon casting. For example, a 10th-level wizard would receive 5 skins while a 20th-level wizard would receive 10. For each skin the wizard possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th-level wizard would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against <PRO_HIMHER>, but the 6th would affect <PRO_HIMHER> normally. The skins will remain on the wizard until <PRO_HESHE> is affected by a Dispel Magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell duration expires. It is important to note that this will not protect the wizard from any magical attacks, such as Fireball.~

(Invocation/Evocation)

Level: 6
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

When the wizard casts Chain Lightning, arcs of electrical energy burst from <PRO_HISHER> fingertips. These brilliant arcs of lightning leap at all enemies near the caster, burning them with electrical damage. The lightning causes 1d6 points of damage for every 2 levels of the caster. If the target of the lightning saves vs. Spell, only half damage is inflicted. Thus, a 12th-level wizard will cause 6d6 damage to a victim (3d6 if the victim makes <PRO_HISHER> Saving Throw vs. Spell).~

Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 15-ft.-long cone
Saving Throw: Special

When casting this spell, the wizard causes seven shimmering multicolored rays of light to flash from <PRO_HISHER> hand, portraying all colors of the visible spectrum. Any creature with fewer than 8 Hit Dice struck by a ray is blinded for 5 rounds, regardless of any other effect. All creatures caught within the area of effect will be touched by 1 or 2 of the rays, each of which has a different power and purpose:

  Red — Inflicts 20 points of damage; Save vs. Spell for half.
  Orange — Inflicts 40 points of damage; Save vs. Spell for half.
  Yellow — Inflicts 80 points of damage; Save vs. Spell for half.
  Green — Save vs. Poison or die; survivors take 20 points of poison damage.
  Blue — Save vs. Petrification or be turned to stone.
  Indigo — Save vs. Wand or be feebleminded.
  Violet — Save vs. Spell or be disintegrated.~

Saving Throw: None

A duplicate of the caster is created with this spell. The duplicate is almost identical to the caster, making it a very powerful ally. It is created at 60% of the caster's level and has all the spells and abilities that the caster would have at that level. It also has 60% of the caster's Hit Points and is fully under <PRO_HISHER> control.~

Level: 8
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it launches a massive attack on an enemy wizard's spell defenses. The target's Magic Resistance will be lowered by 10% + 1% per level of the caster. Next, Pierce Shield will cancel one spell protection of any level. For example, if this spell was cast by a 15th-level wizard, the target creature would lose 25% Magic Resistance from its current total, reducing it to 0 if less than that remains, as well as canceling one spell protection if the Mage currently has one. The list of spells that this includes: Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Spell Turning, Spell Deflection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Spell Turning, Spell Shield, and Spell Trap. Magic Resistance does not affect this spell, nor do any of the spell protections. The resistance remains lowered for 1 round per level of the caster. It cannot be dispelled.~

This spell allows a wizard to store spells in a magical ability (accessed via the Special Ability button) that is created by the spell. This item, the trigger, can store three spells to be released simultaneously, all of which must be of 6th level or lower. A wizard can only possess one spell trigger at a time, and the trigger may not be given to other characters. Once the spell trigger is used, the icon will disappear from the Special Ability button.~

(Abjuration)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 18 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This powerful spell creates a barrier of magical protection around the spellcaster. Every spell that hits the barrier is absorbed by the power of the spell trap—making the caster recall a previously cast spell. For example, if a wizard shields <PRO_HIMHER>self with Spell Trap and is then hit by a Flame Arrow (3rd-level spell), <PRO_HESHE> gets three spell levels back—<PRO_HESHE> will regain one spell up to 3rd level in power.

The spell trap provides 30 levels of protection (i.e., ten Flame Arrows or five Fingers of Death). The spell trap can absorb any level of spell, from one to nine.~

When this spell is cast at a target creature, it will dispel all of the magical protections that surround that creature. This includes Minor Spell Turning, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Minor Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Spell Shield, Spell Deflection, and Spell Trap. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~

Level: 9
Range: 0

Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Chain Contingency channels some of the magical energy of the wizard and releases it only under certain circumstances. The wizard chooses three spells that will be released under certain conditions, such as being hit by an enemy. When this condition occurs, all three spells are cast immediately. Spells of 8th level or lower may be used in the contingency.~

(Alteration)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting a Time Stop spell, the wizard causes the flow of time to stop for 1 round in the area of effect. Inside the sphere, the caster is free to act for 3 rounds of apparent time. The wizard can move and act freely within the area where time is stopped, but all other creatures are frozen in their actions, for they are literally between ticks of the clock. The spell's duration is subjective to the caster. Nothing can enter the area of effect without being stopped in time also. When the spell's duration ceases, the wizard is again operating in normal time. Note that all spells cast during the Time Stop will take effect immediately after time returns to normal.~

The casting of this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane, draining <PRO_HIMHER> of 2 levels of experience. The target of this spell loses levels, Hit Dice, Hit Points, and abilities permanently. These levels can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell.~

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, a wizard is able to assume the form of a powerful creature (mind flayer, iron golem, greater wolfwere, earth elemental, fire elemental, or giant troll). The spellcaster becomes the creature <PRO_HESHE> wishes and has almost all of its abilities. Thus, <PRO_HESHE> can change into a mind flayer to stun <PRO_HISHER> opponents and then become an earth elemental to crush <PRO_HISHER> foes. These creatures have whatever Hit Points the wizard had at the time of the shapechange. Each alteration in form requires only a second, and no system shock is incurred.~

When this spell is cast, the recipient receives a resistance to all magic. The resistance conferred is 2% per level of the caster, up to a maximum of 40% at 20th level.

Our names are the same in their scale and their cut.
The last of his begins just as the first of mine.
The second of my first is the second of his first, though regressed a full four steps.
The third of my first is four more than the last of his first.
The entire last of my first is the last of his first, except the first one of these is the first of my last.
The first of his last is mine plus one.
The next of my last is the last of his first plus one.
The last of my last are third and second, coming in first for him.

"Monkey Balls"
These sweet and gracious monkey balls,
Served on plates and sold from stalls,
Bring madness to these hallowed halls
Of urban academe.

Huzzaks for chocolate monkey balls!
We'll eat them 'til the ceiling falls,
'Til Time herself tears down these walls
Of urban academe.

So buy yourself a monkey ball,
Savour it and then stand tall,
A bulwark 'gainst the deaf'ning call
Of urban academe.

2 carrots, sliced
1 celery stalk, thinly sliced
1 small cabbage, shredded
1 large onion, sliced
1 garlic clove, minced

Baldur's Delight
Sweet treats from the fabled kitchen of Mother Baldur.

5 tablespoons cornstarch
1/2 cup chilled water
1/2 cup hot water
1/2 cup orange juice
2 cups sugar
1 teaspoon lemon juice (or an exotic, such as rosewater)
2 cups of nuts (again, as exotic as you like)
A portion of powdered sugar or some other topical candy sprinkle

Mix the cornstarch thoroughly with the cold water and set to the side.
Blend the hot water, orange juice, and sugar together, bringing the mixture to a boil.
To this, add the cornstarch and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring often.

Remove from heat, stir in the nuts, and add the lemon juice or your alternate flavoring.
Pour the entire mixture into a buttered or greased pan and chill.

When set, cut sections of about an inch and roll in the powdered sugar or sprinkles to prevent it sticking.

Enjoy.~

A cookie to reinforce the fortitude, from the kitchen of a particularly shaggy friend:

Ruby Racks:

1 cup of dry oatmeal
2 cups of flour
1/4 pound of butter
2 eggs
1/2 cup of cocoa
1/2 cup of sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla
1 teaspoon walnut extract

While oven preheats to 350, combine all ingredients in a large bowl, adding a small amount of milk if the mixture is too dry to properly blend. Add extra sugar if the batter is not to your liking at this point. Roll into balls and press on a greased pan. Bake for 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of your portions and your personal preference for consistency.

Jinkies, they're good!~

@31865 = ~The Vampiricus Omnibus: Unabridged
Ending the Plague of Teeth
This tome is quite ancient, and you do not recognize the tongue in which it is written. Fortunately, Bodhi has scrawled a translation of selected passages in the margins, as well as further questions she apparently wished to ask on the subject.

"Stuat tuo Gotha:
The resolution:
With the witch at the fore, long previous to her treachery, we did stride the hills of Umar seeking comfort in our hour of need. The time had come for the living to mourn no more, and the blades that were fettered by sentiment were cut free, and it was decided that we would speak for our lives with the sinews of our sword arms. The honored dead that did take flight in the darkness of shadow would no more receive sorrow from those of us that had lost their friends and relatives to the plague of teeth.

Mornat de'pas Golvana Fathorn:
Battles when came the dead:
There came we, the army of light, armed with faith and conviction, and we did march unto the tombs of the restless dead during hours of day. With wooden edge, we struck down master and slave, though many paid for each thrust with their lives. In the fallen, there was the danger of a scourge anew, and many of the newly infected seemed doomed to walk again with dire purpose.

Aegato Davon:
The plea:
'No more,' cried we! No more would we lose to the plague. These new fallen could not be abandoned. We had fought for our lives and theirs, and they would not be taken. To the Temple we went, to the god of Sun and Light. Amaunator would save them. Amaunator, whose touch turns shadows to fire. In the arms of the Sun god were the infected placed, and the hearts of their dark masters were laid there with them. Blood did burn, and the dead returned, but not as undead or unliving, but alive and freed from taint. Many did walk the light side home, when last the plague did fall.

Relevance of archaic worship of Amaunator?
Origin of vampiric plague?
Any link to a modern cure to be worried of?
Historical document or historical fiction?"

A final note is scribbled...

"*Interrogate Oghma monk at Docks District temple about further information. He should be able to provide more information on reversing vampirism*"

(Necromancy)

Level: 7
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 6 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 4-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

The Control Undead spell allows the caster to take control of undead creatures within the area of effect. This creates a telepathic link between the caster and the undead, allowing complete control. If the undead have 3 Hit Dice or less, then there is no Saving Throw allowed; however, if they have 4 Hit Dice or more, a Save vs. Spell is allowed to negate the effect. The undead remain under the control of the caster for the duration of the spell or until they are affected by a Dispel Magic.~

(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell, the wizard causes all friendly creatures within the area of effect to be affected by the spell Improved Invisibility. This spell is similar to the Invisibility spell, but the recipient is able to attack, either by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting, and remain unseen. Note, however, that there are sometimes telltale traces, a shimmering, so that an observant opponent can attack the invisible spell recipient. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made <PRO_HISHER> presence known). Attacks against the invisible character suffer -4 penalties to the attack rolls, and the invisible character's Saving Throws are made with a +4 bonus.~

@32429 = ~Invisibility, 10' Radius
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 10-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes all friendly creatures within 10 ft. of the caster to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature(s) are not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature(s) detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature(s) or their gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature(s) become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature(s). The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the wizard or recipient cancels it, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. The invisible being(s) cannot open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc. If they attack, they immediately become visible, although the invisibility enables them to attack first.~

It is exceedingly efficient in combat, having just recently destroyed a score of dretch and chasme demons, though it was damaged in the encounter. These notes will serve as a reminder to me on the proper method of constructing the golem should it be destroyed.

Note to self: Avoid engaging other planar creatures. The exercise is quite difficult and better left to the golem.

A standard golem requires two legs, two arms, and a head. Be wary that some denizen of the sphere does not steal any of my spare golem pieces. It would be frustrating to have to actually track down the pieces myself.

The most difficult task comes after the pieces are assembled in the workroom. To activate the golem, you must...

Level: 9
Range: Special
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

NOTE: Cast this spell in an area where you know someone is imprisoned, and they will be released.

This is the reverse of the spell Imprisonment. When a creature is imprisoned, <PRO_HESHE> is trapped in a sphere far beneath the surface of the earth. If this spell is cast in the area where <PRO_HESHE> was imprisoned, it will instantly free <PRO_HIMHER> and <PRO_HESHE> will reappear exactly where <PRO_HESHE> was standing when <PRO_HESHE> was imprisoned. This spell will also cancel the effects of the spell Maze and return any characters trapped in the labyrinth of planes.~

(Necromancy)

Level: 9
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The casting of this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane, draining <PRO_HIMHER> of 2 levels of experience. The target of this spell loses levels, Hit Dice, Hit Points, and abilities permanently. These levels can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell.~

(Necromancy)

Level: 7
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the life energy level of the recipient is raised. This reverses any previous life energy level drain of the creature by a force or monster. A Greater Restoration spell will also restore the Intelligence score of a creature affected by the Feeblemind spell and negate any form of insanity, such as confusion or berserk. It fully heals the target and cures any diseases or poisons. The casting of this spell is very draining on the priest, and <PRO_HESHE> will likely require rest immediately afterward.~

Goodbye. No sappy farewells or crying over how things must be; I do neither of these things well, nor would I wish to. I have made a decision, one that is not ideal, but it is necessary. I can go nowhere without this shadow, and I wish to leave it behind. I am returning to the Harper Hold that I might face judgment there. I will plead the case as we saw it for whatever they accuse, and if they do not see reason, then I will suffer what I must. Galvarey had detractors as well as allies, so I believe I can end this in my favor. If not, at least it will be an end.

I do not ask you to follow. I do this for myself, and there will be little or no gain for you. You may still be a target of violence, but perhaps their interest in you will wither beside the capture of a "traitor."

For better or worse, I am taking control once more. I hope to see you again in better times.

(Divination)

Level: 4
Range: Special
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

@38565 = ~Animal Friendship
(Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Animal
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 hr.
Area of Effect: 1 animal
Saving Throw: Neg.

By means of this spell, the caster is able to show any animal of animal intelligence to semi-intelligence (i.e., Intelligence 1-4) that <PRO_HESHE> desires friendship. If the animal does not roll a successful Saving Throw vs. Spell immediately when the spell is begun, it stands quietly while the caster finishes the spell. Thereafter, it follows the caster about. The spell functions only if the caster actually wishes to be the animal's friend. If the caster has ulterior motives, the animal always senses them (for example, if the caster intends to eat the animal, send it ahead to set off traps, etc.).

The caster can teach the befriended animal three specific tricks or tasks for each point of Intelligence it possesses. Typical tasks are those taught to a dog or similar pet (i.e., they cannot be complex). Training for each such trick must be done over a period of one week, and all must be done within three months of acquiring the creature. During the three-month period, the animal will not harm the caster, but if the creature is left alone for more than a week, it will revert to its natural state and act accordingly.

The caster can use this spell to attract up to 2 Hit Dice of animal(s) per experience level <PRO_HESHE> possesses. This is also the maximum total Hit Dice of the animals that can be attracted and trained at one time: no more than twice the caster's experience level. Only unaligned animals can be attracted, befriended, and trained.~

(Abjuration, Evocation)

Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 4 hrs. + ' hr./level
Casting Time: 1 rd.
Area of Effect: Up to 20-ft. cube
Saving Throw: None

When an alarm spell is cast, the wizard causes a selected area to react to the presence of any creature larger than a normal rat—anything larger than about ' cubic foot in volume or more than about three pounds in weight. The area of effect can be a portal, a section of floor, stairs, etc. As soon as any creature enters the warded area, touches it, or otherwise contacts it without speaking a password established by the caster, the alarm spell lets out a loud ringing that can be heard clearly within a 60-foot radius. (Reduce the radius by 10 feet for each interposing door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall.) The sound lasts for one round and then ceases. Ethereal or astrally projected creatures do not trigger an alarm, but flying or levitating creatures, invisible creatures, or incorporeal or gaseous creatures do. The caster can dismiss the alarm with a single word.~

Fireball
(Evocation)

Level: 3
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

A Fireball is an explosive burst of flame, which detonates with a low roar and delivers damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it—1d6 points of damage for each level of experience of the caster (up to a maximum of 10d6). The wizard points <PRO_HISHER> finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the Fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation). Creatures failing their Saving Throws each suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful Saving Throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half.~

The spell on this page is:

Invisibility
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 2
Range: Touch
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes the creature touched to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or its gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. The caster cannot perform any actions that manipulate the environment around <PRO_HIMHER>, such as opening doors, disarming a trap, or opening a chest. The caster can, however, cast defensive spells on <PRO_HIMHER>self and fellow party members. And if <PRO_HESHE> attacks, <PRO_HESHE> immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables <PRO_HIMHER> to attack first.~

When this spell is cast, an area roughly 120 ft. in radius around the caster will be affected. Instantly and once each round for 1 turn after this spell is cast, all hostile Illusion/Phantasm spells in the area of effect will be dispelled. The spells that are affected by this are Reflected Image, Invisibility, Mirror Image, Non-Detection, Improved Invisibility, Shadow Door, Mislead, Project Image, and Simulacrum. The area of effect is roughly a 120-ft. radius around the caster. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not come into effect with this spell. This spell only affects enemies; thus, it is unable to dispel the invisibility from a party member.~

Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4

Lightning Bolt
(Evocation)

Level: 3
Range: 120 ft. + 30 ft./level
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

Upon casting this spell, the wizard releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy that inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster (maximum damage of 10d6) to each creature within its area of effect. A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell reduces this damage to half (round fractions down). The bolt begins at a range and height decided by the caster and streaks outward in a direct line from the casting wizard (e.g., if a 40-ft. bolt was started at 180 ft. from the wizard, the far end of bolt would reach 220 ft. (180+40)). If the Lightning Bolt intersects with a wall, it will bounce until it reaches its full length.~

While her opponent was thus held, the Lady would slowly bleed them, sometimes taking several hours before allowing her subject to succumb to the final agony of death. The Lady finally fell victim to her own evil; disarmed by a rival and struck by her own stiletto, her fate was soon sealed.

Level: 5
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is only available to Harpers. Harper's Call restores a comrade to life to further service the cause of the Harpers. This spell functions similarly to Raise Dead, with the following exceptions: The Harper must transfer a small portion of her life essence (10 Hit Points) to successfully raise the deceased person; the person has but 1 Hit Point when raised and must regain the rest by natural healing or curative magic; and the raised person suffers a -5 penalty to all ability scores except Constitution for one minute, making this spell virtually useless in combat.

@44943 = ~Iron Skins
(Alteration)

Sphere: Elemental
Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When a Druid casts this powerful spell upon <PRO_HIMHER>self, an outer skin of iron will move up from the ground, completely covering <PRO_HIMHER>. This skin is, of course, magical and will hinder the Druid in no way. The effect of this is to protect the Druid from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. For every 2 levels of the caster, an additional skin is gained upon casting. For example, a 10th-level Druid would receive 5 skins. For each skin the Druid possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th-level Druid would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against <PRO_HIMHER> but the 6th would affect <PRO_HIMHER> normally. The skins will remain on the Druid until <PRO_HESHE> is affected by a Dispel Magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell's duration expires. It is important to note that this will not protect the Druid from any area attacks such as Fireball; however, it will protect <PRO_HIMHER> from physical magical attacks such as Magic Missile.~

Level: 3
Sphere: Animal
Range: 90 ft.
Duration: 7 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

The Summon Insects spell attracts a cloud or swarm of normal insects to attack one enemy of the caster. This swarm gathers at a point chosen by the caster within the spell's range and attacks any single creature the caster points to. The victim may make a Saving Throw vs. Breath Weapon with a -4 penalty to escape the swarm; otherwise, the victim receives 1 point of damage every 2 seconds for the duration of the spell. Moreover, the victim fights with a -2 penalty to <PRO_HISHER> attack roll and a -2 penalty to <PRO_HISHER> Armor Class. The swarm will repeatedly bite the target, making it very difficult to cast spells (50% chance of spell failure).~

(Conjuration/Summoning)

Sphere: Combat
Level: 5
Range: 360 ft.
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast by the priest, a horde of creeping, hopping, and flying insects gather and swarm. This swarm will jump first to the enemy target, then to the nearest allies of the target's, until up to 6 creatures have been affected. Spellcasting within the swarm is impossible (100% chance of spell failure). Creatures in the insect plague sustain 1 point of damage every 2 seconds they remain within regardless of their Armor Class, due to the bites and stings of the insects. Invisibility is no protection. Due to the suffocating nature of the writhing insect swarm, each victim must make a Saving Throw vs. Breath Weapon or run away in fear for 1 round.~

(Alteration)

Level: 7
Sphere: Elemental (Earth)
Range: 360 ft.
Duration: 3 tremors
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast, a local tremor of fairly high strength rips the ground. The shock is over in several rounds. The earthquake affects all creatures in its area of effect. There are 3 tremors that are caused by the earthquake:

 1st: All creatures affected take 6d6 points of damage and fall to the ground for 4 rounds. A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -6 penalty halves the damage and negates the fall.
 2nd: All creatures affected take 3d6 points of damage. A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -2 penalty halves the damage.
 3rd: All creatures affected take 2d6 points of damage. A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell halves the damage.

This spell will affect both enemies and friends of the caster's, so care must be taken in its use. Finally, earth elementals dislike mere mortals toying with the land and there is a small chance that casting this spell will cause an earth elemental to appear and attack the party.~

I have defeated the rival guild, full of vampires as it was, and have faced Bodhi. She claimed to know something of Imoen and seemed to be judging me in some manner before she left in gaseous form. All that remains now is to return to Aran and tell him that the guild is gone, even if their leader remains unkilled. I will have questions for him as well.

One more troubling thing... Bodhi knew. She knew I am a child of Bhaal.~

@47839 = ~Aran's tasks to receive the Shadow Thieves' aid

I have completed the tasks Aran Linvail set out for me, and at last the location of Imoen has been revealed. This did not come, mind you, without some revelations.

The Shadow Thieves have been interested in me from the beginning. They were aware of my capture, but thought it nothing more than a simple kidnapping and none of their business. However, soon after that, Bodhi appeared and their members started disappearing. They thought another guild was converting them, making a bid for control of the city's underground, and directed an attack against what they thought was the guild headquarters, Irenicus's dungeon below Waukeen's.

They were totally unprepared for how strong Irenicus was. After the battle, they set their sights on me because I was the only thing that came out of that dungeon alive. Since I was of such interest to Irenicus, they needed to know what I was up to. Once they realized that Irenicus was a threat to us both, they sought to aid me, while also aiding themselves. Their intentions were good, despite their selfish motive.

They believe that Irenicus is still very much a threat. Both Irenicus and Imoen have been taken to an island asylum called Spellhold where mages are imprisoned and studied. And yet it sounds doubtful that Irenicus has been so easily overcome. Bodhi and her rival guild are tied to him in some manner... and his purpose in studying both myself and Imoen is still unknown.

Imoen still remains in that place, however. The Shadow Thieves have arranged a ship to take me to the isle at no small expense, hoping in that retrieving Imoen I might rid them of their other problem as well. Whatever happens, I am sure my biggest challenge yet awaits me on this isle.~

@57352 = ~The Unholy Reaver: Ir'revrykal
This dark, two-handed sword radiates evil from a distance. The weapon is not just unholy, but unearthly as well. Long thought to be just a myth, the blade's infamy pervades the accounts of learned bards and ancient sages. According to these accounts, the githyanki wizard-smith Ir'mlar forged the blade many centuries ago in dark caverns deep beneath Tu'narath. This githyanki city floats in the Astral Plane upon the petrified corpse of a dead god known only as "the One in the Void." To craft the sword, Ir'mlar allegedly used the One's own bones, which consist of a metallic substance unknown on the Prime Material Plane. The smith then imbued the weapon with a fiendish entity whom some seers claim was a mighty prince of the lower plane of Carceri. Others claim the sword contains the One in the Void's own spirit, banished within the blade for crimes committed against other gods in past ages. In any case, Ir'revrykal possesses such an enmity against good that only blackguards committed to evil may wield it. Circular runes etched on the blade proclaim its name in ancient tir'su, the githyanki language. The runes translate roughly as "Pain-Servant."

If I set the air mage's fan on high and open all the doors between the fan room, my own lab, and the ice wizard's frigid chamber, the drafts will blow my toxic vapors down the hall towards the frost wizard's minions. Once touched by the poison gas, they will become tainted and vulnerable. That snowblind fool won't know what hit him!

The flame mage, with his "invincible" servant, is the worst, of course. But I have discovered the secret to destroying his precious giant!

The fire elementals are the key—dispatch them and the giant becomes vulnerable! I will lure each of the four elementals into my ice lab and destroy them in my frozen realm.

@66199 = ~Welcome to Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal, the expansion pack to Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn and the completion of the Child of Bhaal storyline.

Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal is split into two sections:

1) An Add-In Section—a grand new adventure takes place at Watcher's Keep, a new area on your map in BGII. The keep can be played during the course of BGII. It can also be played after BGII in the Add-On section. Play the Add-In Section simply by loading a BGII save and going to Watcher's Keep.
2) An Add-On Section—This continues the main storyline of Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn. Play the Add-On Section by finishing Baldur's Gate II:Shadows of Amn or by importing your character or party into Throne of Bhaal (see below). Watcher's Keep can also be accessed from the Add-On Section. Once you have started the Add-On section, you can no longer return to Shadows of Amn or its areas.

Clicking the New Game button will take you to the character creation screen, where you can create a character to begin Throne of Bhaal at its beginning, shortly after the events chronicled in Shadows of Amn. You have the option of creating a brand new character, who will be outfitted with two million experience points and a variety of powerful weapons and items. You also have the option of importing a character from a saved game or from the character folder. These characters will also be given items and set to two million experience points, if they haven't already reached this level of experience.

Clicking the Import Game button will allow you to import your party from a BGII saved game, such as your final save from Shadows of Amn. This is also an option from which you can load your Throne of Bhaal saves once you've started the mission pack and saved a game.

Click Cancel to return to the previous menu.

Please enjoy Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal.~

(Necromancy)

Range: 20 ft.
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

Through this spell, the Bhaalspawn can expel the taint of their evil sire onto a victim, poisoning those who fail their Save vs. Death. The effects depend upon the caster's level and are detailed below:
  7 – 9th: 2d8  +  2/round, slowed for 2 rounds, save at -2
  10 – 12th: 3d8  + 3/round, slowed for 2 rounds, save at -2

  17 – 21st: 8d8  +  6/round, slowed for 4 rounds, save at -4

(Necromancy)

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

When using this ability, the Bhaalspawn must picture the faces of <PRO_HISHER> fellow party members clearly and focus on the unity of the group. Upon completion, all party members within a 15-ft. radius of the caster are healed 2d8 + 2/level Hit Points. Other conditions suffered by the party are cured as well: fatigue, poison, disease, blindness, and deafness.~

(Necromancy)

Range: 0
Duration: 1 rounds/5 levels
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When this power is called upon by the Bhaalspawn, <PRO_HESHE> immediately does extra damage with each hit to <PRO_HISHER> target with any melee weapon <PRO_HESHE> wishes, whether it be fist or sword. <PRO_HISHER> dark energies travel through <PRO_HISHER> weapon to assault <PRO_HISHER> victim, allowing <PRO_HIMHER> to absorb that damage as healing to <PRO_HIMHER>self.

The effects vary by level as follows:
  10th – 14th: 2 rounds, 4 extra damage, 4 HP healed
  15th – 19th: 3 rounds, 6 extra damage, 6 HP healed
  20th – 24th: 4 rounds, 8 extra damage, 8 HP healed
  25th – 29th: 5 rounds, 10 extra damage, 10 HP healed

Gargantua was self-proclaimed lord of his immeasurable lower regions until his son, Pantagruel, questioned the accuracy of the ruler. With his shortcomings exposed, great Gargantua lay prostrate upon the ground while Pantagruel sought to cover his cuirass in case his now governing body lost its sway. He was warned that the people would cut him no slacks, but he never listened, and had burned his britches behind him. Undaunted, he fulfilled his animus with the robes of his father, as uncomfortable as that might sound, and shaped the Metal "Unit" with his own hands.

The rule of Pantagruel was a discommoding morass, his armor eventually suffering a breach in the breech that proved his undoing. As his basket left the pantry, so to speak, his regime fell to insurrection, and so complete was the sacking that not even his Metal "Unit" could be found. The component pieces, a pantaloon triumvirate, were lost in the annals of time.

You now bear the awesome responsibility of the Metal "Unit." Gussets of wind, seams like reality, pockets of resistance, the seat of power, and legs as flared as your temper. Polish it well; the onus is now on you.

@73946 = ~Elminster's Ecologies: Appendix IIIa

This timeworn tome is written by the sage Elminster and apparently part of a much larger body of work containing detailed studies of most of the strange creatures from around Faerûn.

The appendix seems to refer to newly discovered variations on normal breeds of creatures. Of particular interest:

"Dense Puddings—a relative of the slimes and molds, this pudding is relatively normal... except when exposed to electricity or fire. When this occurs, it splits into new puddings and can therefore be very dangerous."

"Fire Trolls—a new form of troll thought to have been created by sorcerous fire giants for use as servants and guards. They are similar to regular trolls in most respects except for their lava-temperature skin and burning touch. Once they are defeated, they can only be permanently killed by cold or acid."

"Fission Slime—an offshoot of the slimes and molds, this particular slime will split into new and independent creatures when hit. It is vulnerable to fire, which will kill it permanently."

"Magic Golems—this rare type of golem is formed from pure magical energy and is completely immune to spellcraft as well as enchanted weapons. To my knowledge, only weapons without enchantments have any effects on this creature."

"Mariliths—while this is apparently a legitimate form of demon, it is one that only an exceptional few have encountered and survived. The marilith is a six-armed demon with a human female front half and the back half of a snake. She is incredibly quick and deadly, and on top of her martial prowess with six swords, she casts spells as well. Fighters should beware: In addition to being immune to normal weapons and minor enchantments, this demon also likes to cast protection from magical weapons... which must be dispelled if a fighter is to have any chance with his armaments."~

Despite his vampiric abilities, he was cut down on more than one occasion. Upon reverting to a gaseous form, he would have to travel a long distance back to his camp before he could enter his coffin to regenerate. Turning to the magical arts once again, Dragomir had his coffin placed within a bag of holding and had it magically bound so that it could not be removed. Then, when he was cut down, he only had to travel a short way to a trusted knight that held the bag for him.

It was this trust, however, that ultimately resulted in him being betrayed and entombed for centuries.

The bag itself is a common cloth sack of about two feet by four feet in size. It opens into a non-dimensional space, with its inside being vastly larger than the outside. Regardless of whatever is placed into this bag, it will always have the same weight. Though a bag of holding has no atmosphere within, vampires have no need to breathe and can rest inside comfortably.

When placed upon the head of an undead creature, powerful magic stuns the wearer and prevents them from moving entirely while the casque remains on their head. Hexxat, not realizing this, erroneously woke Dragomir from his slumber when she attempted to steal the Casque.

Centuries ago in the Zakharan desert, four hakima—Rabi'ah, Aminah, Bilqis, and Sukayna—predicted the birth of a great prophet who would lead Halwa into a golden age of prosperity and enlightenment. The mother of this auspicious child was to be a woman named Badiat—who did not even know she was pregnant until her husband, Muharr, was slain fighting bandits at the caliph's behest.

The hakima invited Badiat to live under the caliph's protection. She quickly impressed the caliph with her weaving, creating beautiful abas and catans. He added her to his harem and commanded his merchants to bring her the finest silks from every corner of the peninsula.

The caliph's first wife, Raffiyah, previously in charge of all weaving for the caliph's household, grew jealous of Badiat. Finding an ally in the fourth hakim, a wicked woman, she conspired to poison Badiat. The conspirators slew both mother and child, leaving the unborn baby "a prophet unproved."

Too late, the three virtuous hakima discovered the crime and revealed it to the caliph. Enraged, he ordered all four hakima buried along with Badiat and her unborn child, as punishment for their failure to not just him, but all of Halwa.~

Feral and undomesticated, his pets would often wander off, disappearing for days and filling Barad with concern. After weeks of worry, he decided to affix leather collars with tiny, magical bells on his companions. Whenever Barad would utter the command word, all bells in a certain radius ring melodically, revealing their locations.

While enchanting the bells, Barad's magic was sometimes warped by wild surges, some harmless, some less so. The surge that erupted when he crafted this particular bell amplified Barad's magic to the extreme—instead of a soft tinkling, it emits a deafening burst of sound, capable of instantly waking anyone even from their deepest slumber.

STATISTICS:

Charge abilities:
– Three times a day, the bell can wake everyone from sleep in 15-ft. radius. Anyone who fails a Saving Throw vs. Spell becomes deaf for 1 turn.

While Zulann was successful, the cloak severely dampened many of the vampiric abilities that Dragomir had come to enjoy.

For this inconvenience, she was drained of her lifeblood by Dragomir and left to die.

Saving Throw: Neg.

A vampire's mental abilities are powerful tools indeed. Domination enables the vampire to control the actions of any creature while the ability is in effect. This control is maintained through a telepathic link between the caster and the victim. Unlike the 4th-level priest spell Mental Domination, the target has no option for release, even if made to do something against their morals. This effect can only be reversed by Dispel Magic. The target is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -2 penalty to negate the effect.~

(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 4
Range: Touch
Duration: 15 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Improved Invisibility allows Cerebus to vanish from sight for up to 15 rounds. However, if he attacks during that time, a telltale shimmering will give away his general position, allowing an observant opponent to target him. Attacks against Cerebus while he is invisible suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls, and his Saving Throws are made with a +4 bonus during this time.

This ability also grants Cerebus nondetection, rendering him undetectable by divination spells such as Invisibility Purge.~

(Conjuration)

Level: 4
Sphere: Summoning
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

As the Shaman casts this spell, energies gather together from the spirit world and form a pale blue sphere. The Shaman can throw the sphere so that it explodes into a burst of ghostly, azure flames, which deliver 1d4 points of magic damage per level of the Shaman (up to a maximum of 10d4). There is also a 33% chance that every enemy within the area of effect will be afflicted by the Doom spell (-2 penalty to Saving Throws and attack rolls for 1 turn). A successful Save vs. Spell halves the damage and negates the Doom effect. Spirits, fey creatures, elementals, and spectral undead take double damage.~

@103074 = ~Recall Spirit
(Necromancy)

Level: 5
Sphere: Summoning
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: None

The shaman calls back a deceased person's spirit if it still lingers near the body. By casting this spell, the Shaman reconnects the spirit to its body and restores the person to life with 1 Hit Point. Natural healing or curative magic can restore the rest of the target's vitality.~

@103079 = ~Ether Gate
(Alteration)

Level: 7
Sphere: Travelers
Range: Touch
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell transports one creature, chosen by the caster, to the Ethereal Plane. The creature vanishes for the spell's duration, at which point it returns to the physical world in the exact same spot where it was before. While in the Ethereal Plane, the victim cannot interact with anyone or anything that resides on the Prime Material Plane. There is no saving throw against this spell, though it is subject to magic resistance. Friendly creatures can lower their magic resistance so that the shaman can target them with this spell. In addition, Ether Gate is blocked by spells and abilities that protect against maze effects.~

(Conjuration)

Level: Quest
Sphere: Summoning
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

Ghostly figures called by the Shaman swirl around the battlefield, tormenting the Shaman's adversaries. All enemies within the area of effect take 3d8 points of magic damage per round for the next 3 rounds (no save). In addition, all living enemies (undead and constructs are unaffected) must save vs. Spell or lose 2 points of Strength every round for 5 rounds. The Strength loss is cumulative, but this spell cannot reduce the Strength of a creature below 1.~

An orc fleeing the site of the battle snatched the fragment up as she ran. This she gave to her tribe's shaman, who immediately recognized its power and fashioned it into an amulet.

The Heart of the Mountain is of particular use to those who do the Ghost Dance. Such folk dwell at least partly in the realm of the spirits; the amulet forges a stronger connection 'twixt them and the earth, lending its wearer strength in the face of physical adversity.
