// proficency Clubs -> Hammers
@4845 = ~POOR QUALITY SLEDGEHAMMER
Damage: 2-7 Crushing
Speed: 8
Weight: 10
Proficiency: Hammers
Usable only by Fighters

This hammer is little more than a heavy lump of metal on the end of a stout stick. It's powerful, yes, but the balance is poor and it's entirely ungraceful.~

//  Piece -> Charm - changing identified name to match identified description
@5127 = ~Clipped Copper Charm~

@30450 = ~DIRTY RAT CHARM
Special:
   +10% Stealth Skill Bonus
   +5% Pickpocket Skill Bonus
   -1 to Charisma
Weight: 0
Usable only by Thieves

This cranium rat tail charm is particularly filthy and smells faintly of vomit. The tail is stiff, like a wire, and it can be bent into different shapes... it would almost make a great lockpick, except it is too thick.

When this rank charm is consumed, the user temporarily becomes much stealthier and shiftier, giving them a greater chance of success with hiding in shadows and picking pockets. People viewing the charmed individual will detect something unsavory about him, however, reducing first impressions accordingly. This unsavoriness will last only as long as the charm is in effect, however.~

@46627 = ~ACIDIC SPONGE BOLTS
Damage: 1-2 Crushing
Enchanted: +1
Special: 6 Acid Damage on Impact
Speed: 10
Weight: 0
Proficiency: Missiles

The putty-like globes on the heads of these crossbow bolts are actually dried-up aquatic sponges found in many of the great lakes of Bytopia. Seemingly unremarkable to most scholars, these tiny sponges were accidentally discovered to have the property of being able to absorb acids and store them in their bodies with no harm to themselves.

As a result, great masses of these creatures were gathered and bred for use as weapons against fiends in the Blood War. After being fed a steady diet of acid for a few days, the sponges are harvested, dried, and covered with a resin that keeps a soft bubble around the sponge. The sponge is then mounted on the head of an arrow or crossbow bolt and is ready for use.

When the tip of the bolt strikes a creature with sufficient force, the resin bubble bursts, the sponge flattens, and the target is doused with acid.~
