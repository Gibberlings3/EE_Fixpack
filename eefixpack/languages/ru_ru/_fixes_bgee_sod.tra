// this will form the basis for the string fixes for this game. Simply add strings as needed and the installer will replace
// the corresponding string in the tlk. Remember to comment why a string is being updated. Once you have legitimate
// strings to replace, rename this file WITHOUT the underscore at the beginning.

// any strings < 34000 are non-sod strings and should go into the fixes_bgee.tra file instead.

// strref #34567, updating because "X is misspelled"
@34567 = ~This is a test replacement string.~
