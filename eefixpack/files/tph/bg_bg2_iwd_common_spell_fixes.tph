Summon Nishruu / Hakeashar
- their attack (`nishrusu.itm`) should ignore all `AC` modifiers
  - previously, since it was using `damage_type=piercing`, the Nishruu (`THAC0=11`) would need to roll a Critical Hit in order to hit `AC -9 vs. piercing` attacks targets. A similar argument holds for the Hakeashar
    - this is certainly unintended since they don't actually deal piercing damage
- they should be vulnerable to Dispel/Remove Magic
- they should be flagged as `GENERAL=MONSTER` / `RACE=MIST` / `CLASS=MIST` on all games
- make sure the Nishruu has 100% Poison resistance
- The Hakeashar should have the same passive traits as the Nishruu
  - i.e., it should be immune to Poison and see invisible creatures
- the Nishruu should use the `NISHRUU` animation on all games
- the Hakeashar should use the `HAKEASHAR` animation on all games
- removed unused spell setup
