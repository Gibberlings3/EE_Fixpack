Can't fix/unsure about.
Helm of Defense 'Gift of Peace' (helm04): a unique item in oBG1, but it appears twice (in fairly generic places) in BG2 and again in a store added in EE. NO GENERIC COPY.
Ring of Regeneration. Unique in oBG2, cloned by BD. ??? - no generic.
Ring of Invisibility, 'Sandthief's Ring (ring05). Cattie-Brie has it, so does the Crooked Crane lich, so does a patsy in ToB. And BD puts it into a store.
??? My inclination is to remove all but the Grave Lich's copy.
Boots of Grounding (boot05): sold by the wandering priest of Tempus in the fighter stronghold quest and by the temple of Lathander. NO GENERIC.

Bracers of Defense AC 6: there are more than a dozen of these in BG2, always given as fairly generic bling. I think here it makes sense just to
make the original one generic (its unique description is just inherited from BG1). It's easy to adapt it from the AC6 description.

Vaelasa is probably the most critical-path person, sho she can get the unique version.

I don't know what BD had in mind here. On aesthetic grounds it should probably stay with the drow (it's darker-colored).
