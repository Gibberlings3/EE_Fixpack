Amulet of protection +1, 'The Protector'

Carried by Nadine (questgiver), who actively gives it to you to hand to her son, and Ragefast (questgiver), who just has it as
protective bling. Found loose in ar0169 (a generic home). Sold in Feldepost's Inn, the Elfsong Tavern, and Zordral's tent.

Proposal: Nadine is easily the most significant/evocative.
