<p><strong>Developer note:</strong> this is essentially copy-pasted (minus this paragraph, natch) into the documentation pages on the G3 project page. Feel free to add/adjust the documentation as needed. The class <span class="bg2fp_beta">bg2fp_beta (red)</span> should be used to mark fixes that are in the Beta Core Fixes (nothing yet) and the <span class="bg2fp_modder">bg2fp_modder (magenta)</span> class should be used for modder notes. In the live pages, these are normally colored, but hidden, unless the user enables them. </p>

  <li>The ranger Charm Animal ability does not mention its duration. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strref #100356)</span></li>

  <li>Some  bows and crossbows didn't specify the damage type if they provided bonus damage <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strrefs #7352, #7353, #66390, #66391)</span></li>
  <li>Magical Stone's description indicated that it was subject to weapon restrictions (e.g. struck as a +1 weapon) but this is not true&mdash;it's a normal spell doing normal spell damage like Magic Missile <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strref #12317)</span></li>

  <li>The non-proficiency penalty for Shadowdancers and Mage-Thieves were incorrect. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(clswpbon.2da)</span></li>

  <li>Free Action has an effect to reset movement rate to 100%, but the way it was implemented could interfere with natural speed increases like the movement bonuses for monks or barbarians.

  <li>For larger creatures such as dragons, creature animations were typically split into four quadrants and stitched together on the game screen. Unfortunately, this could sometimes result in <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/image/823-issues-with-large-creature-animations-ii/">visible seams</a> between the four disparate animations or, if a spell was in effect, animations <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/image/822-issues-with-large-creature-animations-i/">cycling out of sync</a> with one another. These larger animations have been merged into a single, monolithic animation to address these issues. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(all mdem*.bam, mdr1*.bam, mdr2*.bam, mdr3*.bam, mwyv*.bam)</span></li>

<p>There were several ways that polymorphing&mdash;whether via a spell like Shapechange, a druid's natural abilities, or from an item like Cloak of the Wolf&mdash;could introduce numerous issues, especially when shifting directly between forms. A creature could retain stats or abilities from a previous form, or forced/voluntary/timed shapheshifts could overrun one another. As such, these abilities went through a complete overhaul designed to streamline the process, cover edge cases, and minimize issues. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bolt05.itm, brblp.itm, brbrp.itm, cdbrbrp.itm, cdbrbrp2.itm, cdgoliro.itm, cdmindfl.itm, cdwolfm.itm, clck04.itm, clck04.spl, clck27.itm, clck27a.spl, clck27b.spl, clck27c.spl, druear.itm, drufir.itm, earthrn.itm, figure01.itm, firern.itm, ohbpr608.spl, plybass.itm, plybear1.itm, plybear2.itm, plyflind.itm, plyjelly.itm, plymstar.itm, plysala.itm, plyspid.itm, plyspid2.itm, plytroll.itm, plywolf1.itm, plywyvrn.itm, polyjell.itm, polyrat.itm, slayerw1.itm, slayerw2.itm, slayerw3.itm, slayerw4.itm, spcl611.spl, spcl612.spl, spcl613.spl, spcl632.spl, spcl633.spl, spcl634.spl, spcl643.spl, spcl644.spl, spcl731.spl, spdm103.spl, spin107.spl, spin110.spl, spin111.spl, spin113.spl, spin122.spl, spin123.spl, spin124.spl, spin125.spl, spin126.spl, spin127.spl, spin150.spl, spin150r.eff, spin151.spl, spin152.spl, spin153.spl, spin154.spl, spin155.spl, spin156.spl, spin157.spl, spin160.spl, spin202.spl, spin663.spl, spin717.spl, spin717a.spl, spin783.spl, spin783a.spl, spin822.spl, spin823.spl, spin823a.spl, spin852.spl, spin852a.spl, spin868.spl, spin869.spl, spin974.spl, spinhum.spl, spinhume.eff, spinhume.spl, spinhumr.spl, spinhums.eff, spinhums.spl, spinhumw.eff, spinhumw.spl, splprot.2da, splstate.ids, sppr110.spl, sppr206.spl, sppr213.spl, sppr414.spl, sppr510.spl, sppr511.spl, sppr608.spl, sppr614.spl, sppr721.spl, sppr731.spl, sppr731a.spl, sppr732.spl, sppr732a.spl, spwi115.spl, spwi117.spl, spwi218.spl, spwi325.spl, spwi415.spl, spwi416.spl, spwi489.spl, spwi489r.eff, spwi490.spl, spwi491.spl, spwi493.spl, spwi494.spl, spwi495.spl, spwi496.spl, spwi497.spl, spwi498.spl, spwi499.spl, spwi518.spl, spwi711.spl, spwi711a.spl, spwi915.spl, spwi916.spl, spwi920.spl, spwi952.spl, spwm113.spl, spwm113a.spl, spwm183.spl, squirp.itm, trollall.itm, uddoor2.bcs, uddoor3.bcs, wand09.itm, wolfchar.cre, wolfgr.itm, wolfm.itm, wswolf.itm)</span></p>

<p>In the original Baldur's Gate, there were four internal methods to make an NPC freeze: paralysis (used in undead melee attacks), web (used by the spell of the same name and spiders), and two forms of hold (one for Hold spells and a second, special one reserved for special cases like cutscenes). As the series progressed through the BG expansion, into BG2, and concluding with Throne of Bhaal, these were used more and more freely, and muddled&mdash;you had web spells using paralysis, abilities that blocked the special hold (which nothing should) to the point where there was little distinction, if any, between these effects from a player's point of view. EEFP is re-establishing the scheme, going all the way back to the original Baldur's Gate, of trying to use these effects in a way that 
  differentiates them and fixes a number of bugs along the way. Paralysis is, once again, the domain of undead attacks, and from which elves have some protection. Web is no longer paired by default with paralysis, meaning items which protect you from web no longer provide paralysis protection by accident, and the special hold will now always take effect. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(amul17.itm, antiweb.itm, ax1h10.itm, bhaalhp1.itm, bhaalimm.itm, blun12.itm, blun25.itm, chalcy3.itm, deva.itm, dragring.itm, dwfpdeva.spl, dwfpdgcn.spl, dwfpdgfb.spl, dwfpohdv.spl, dwfpsmsl.spl, dwfpsmst.spl, dwfpwwfs.spl, dwfpwwhs.spl, enginest.2da, ghoul1.itm, ghoult.itm, gorfirg.itm, gorjelgr.itm, gormisti.itm, hamm10.itm, hamm11.itm, immchs.itm, imoenhp1.itm, insanity.spl, ipsion.itm, jwsuper.itm, kuobolt3.itm, mage05.itm, magiweb.itm, mel01.itm, minhp1.itm, objring.itm, ohbbanno.spl, ohbdeva.itm, ohdmhp1.itm, ohhexam4.itm, ohnwand1.spl, ohrrage.spl, ohsmode1.spl, ohsmode4.spl, ring94.itm, ring95.itm, ring97.itm, ring98.itm, ring99.itm, ringkora.itm, rossring.itm, sengua04.itm, spcl152.spl, spcl233b.spl, spcl242.spl, spcl321.spl, spcl742.spl, spdr201.spl, spermel.itm, spin117.spl, spin566.spl, spin648.spl, spin683.spl, spin872.spl, spin906.spl, spin988.spl, sppr208.spl, sppr305.spl, sppr508.spl, sppr728.spl, sppr989.spl, spwi215.spl, spwi306.spl, spwi324.spl, spwi507.spl, spwi818.spl, spwi818a.spl, spwi918.spl, spwi918a.spl, spwm122.spl, stalker.itm, trollimm.itm, vampreg.itm, vampreg1.itm, vampreg2.itm, wand12.itm, wand14.itm)</span></p>

<p>In the original Baldur's Gate II engine, something that made you 'immune to X' was actually fairly limited: you could make the character directly immune to the effect and (typically) the normal portrait icon, but many of the ancillary effects (sound effects, visuals, etc.) were hit or miss. A party member under free action would resist being paralyzed by a ghast, but the sound effect that plays when the paralysis was supposed to expire would still play. Similarly, creatures immune to confusion would resist the confusion itself but still play a spinning animation over their head for the spell's intended duration. Thankfully, the EEs provide more tools for dealing with immunities, and we can  block all of these subsidiary effects. A parallel issue occurred when removing or curing effects. If you used Remove Fear on a panicking creature, the spinning animation over their head didn't always go away or the expiration sound would still play. Using a new EE feature, these subsidiary effects can be removed when the main effect is removed. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(#cureber.spl, #curebld.spl, #curecon.spl, #curedef.spl, #curedis.spl,

  <p>This is a roundup of fixes that primarily impact modders and are not visible to players. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>IDS tables get sorted (all ids files)</li>
    <li>class.ids, kit.ids, race.ids, and spell.ids <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/39225-discussion-syncing-raceclassids-across-bg-bg2-iwd/">have been synced</a> between BGEE, BG2EE, and IWDEE as best as we are able</li>
    <li>The Neothelid lacked an ini file and correct animate/anisnd.ids entries. (3001.ini, animate.ids, anisnd.ids)</li>
    <li>Several of the splprot.2da entries (specifically, alignment checks) were mislabeled. (splprot.2da)</li>
    <li>Kit ability tables for the archer, dark moon monk, and sun soul monk had missing entries for some columns. (clabmo02.2da, clabmo03.2da, clabrn02.2da)</li>
    <li>Various spells use feedback (op139) with non-permanent timing or non-zero durations. (helm32.itm, spin595.spl, spin878.spl, spin893.spl, spin929.spl, spin931.spl, spwi714.spl, spwi815.spl, spwi958.spl)</li>
    <li>Misindexed items and spells were fixed. (hamm06.itm, ohbwi302.spl, ohbwi304.spl, staf01.itm)</li>
    <li>Detect Evil no longer gets routed through a subspell. On the originals, only evil creatures got checked for magic resistance, which let you know that any 'magic resistance' creature was evil. On the EEs, everyone gets checked which means this is no longer a free check. (spcl212.spl, spin120.spl, sppr101.spl, spwi202.spl)</li>
    <li>Sleep icons are folded into op39 directly on various sleep effects (spin940.spl, spwi004.spl, spwi213.spl, spwi411.spl, spwm187.spl) </li>
    <li>'Bypass mirror image' flags were set on a number of opcodes that don't support it (spin940.spl, spwi004.spl, spwi213.spl, spwm187.spl) </li>
    <li>Spells which use improved invisibility will no longer set normal invisibility as it's redundant (ohbwi405.spl, spdr401.spl, spin544.spl, spin698.spl, spwi405.spl, spwi505.spl) </li>
    <li>Removed duplicate and/or redundant effects from many items and spells (amul17.itm, bdddoorx.spl, bdsha01c.spl, bdsha06b.spl, bdspirim.itm, bdspnaim.itm, bhaalhp1.itm, bhaalimm.itm, blun30.itm, chalcy3.itm, clck04.itm, clck27.itm, dgarchon.spl, dragring.itm, gorchr.itm, gorfirg.itm, gorjelfu.itm, gorjelgr.itm, gormisti.itm, imoenhp1.itm, ipsion.itm, jwsuper.itm, lichtel.spl, mel01.itm, minhp1.itm, misc9y.itm, ohbbanno.spl, ohbdrkrg.itm, ohbjoke2.spl, ohdmhp1.itm, ohrboot1.itm, ohrfear.spl, ohtmps2d.spl, ohtmps2e.spl, potn23.itm, potn25.itm, potn32.itm, potn40.itm, potn45.itm, potn46.itm, ring09.itm, ring95.itm, rodsword.itm, rossring.itm, scrl10.itm, scrl11.itm, scrl12.itm, scrl13.itm, scrl18.itm, scrlpet.itm, sengua04.itm, shld24.itm, shld24a.itm, spcl152.spl, spcl321.spl, spcl611.spl, spcl612.spl, spcl613.spl, spcl632.spl, spcl633.spl, spcl634.spl, spcl643.spl, spcl644.spl, spcl722.spl, spcl900.spl, spcl901.spl, spdr301.spl, sper12.itm, spin107.spl, spin110.spl, spin111.spl, spin117.spl, spin121.spl, spin122.spl, spin123.spl, spin124.spl, spin125.spl, spin126.spl, spin127.spl, spin150.spl, spin151.spl, spin152.spl, spin153.spl, spin154.spl, spin155.spl, spin156.spl, spin157.spl, spin529.spl, spin632.spl, spin667.spl, spin710.spl, spin714.spl, spin717.spl, spin718.spl, spin718a.spl, spin783.spl, spin823.spl, spin852.spl, spin920.spl, spin952.spl, spinhum.spl, sppr111.spl, sppr319.spl, sppr508.spl, sppr517.spl, sppr613.spl, sppr701.spl, sppr704.spl, sppr717.spl, sppr717a.spl, sppr731.spl, sppr732.spl, spra302.spl, spra303.spl, sprngb03.itm, sprngb04.itm, sprngl03.itm, sprngl04.itm, sprngs01.itm, sprngs02.itm, sprngs03.itm, sprngs04.itm, sprngz05.itm, spwi002.spl, spwi222.spl, spwi308.spl, spwi311.spl, spwi318.spl, spwi415.spl, spwi489.spl, spwi490.spl, spwi491.spl, spwi493.spl, spwi494.spl, spwi495.spl, spwi496.spl, spwi497.spl, spwi498.spl, spwi499.spl, spwi511.spl, spwi522.spl, spwi618.spl, spwi701.spl, spwi705.spl, spwi711.spl, spwi723.spl, spwi902.spl, spwi997.spl, surehp1.itm, sw1h27.itm, sw2h21.itm, trollimm.itm, tstatue.itm, wand09.itm, wand19.itm)</li>
    <li>Effects with permanent timing shouldn't have durations (sppr202.spl)</li>
    <li>Various spells and items had to have effects reorganized to facilitate other fixes (ax1h10.itm, blun12.itm, blun25.itm, deva.itm, dwfpdeva.spl, dwfpdgcn.spl, dwfpdgfb.spl, dwfpohdv.spl, dwfpsmsl.spl, dwfpsmst.spl, dwfpwwfs.spl, dwfpwwhs.spl, hamm10.itm, hamm11.itm, insanity.spl, ohbdeva.itm, spermel.itm, wand12.itm)</li>
    <li>Several spells that used swarms of EFFs have been recoded with cleaner  implementations  (sppr707.spl, sppr707a.spl, sppr707b.spl, sppr707c.spl, sppr710.spl, sppr715.spl) </li>
    <li>Targeting for bhaal1a.spl was incorrect (bhaal1a.spl)</li>
    <li> Kit check in splprot.2da is useless since it's a bitwise check, which only works for kits (e.g. mages) which happen to be  powers-of-two. It's changed to be a straight numerical check. (splprot.2da) </li>
    <li>Script action `ChangeStoreMarkup(S:Store*,I:BuyMarkup*,I:SellMarkup*)`was defined with a wrong parameter order (action.ids, actsleep.ids, instant.ids)</li>
    <li>damages.ids lacked a consistent IDS header across games (damages.ids)</li>
    <li>Added REALLYCHARMED to ea.ids (ea.ids)</li>
    <li>The invalid item scrl7a.itm is removed from the unused store (type2.sto)</li>
    <li>Multiple animations had incorrect section names, causing their animations to revert to default values (2000.ini, 2100.ini, 2200.ini, 2300.ini)</li>
    <li>A small Easter egg was fully implemented (ar0903.are, cdhorse1.cre, cdhorse2.cre)</li>
