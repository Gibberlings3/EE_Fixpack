<h2>Fixes for BG2EE</h2>
<h3> String Fixes </h3>
<p> Textual changes were made to correct errors or reflect other changes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Corrected some dialogue  that  indicated that Garren Windspear's cabin was in the wrong direction. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strrefs #6511, #7417, #7421)</span></li>
  <li>Corrected an Underdark journal entry that indicated the dragon eggs were going to be sacrificed to the dragon, not the demon. <span class="bg2fp_modder"> (strref #7148)</span></li>
  <li>The Temple Ruins were referred to as north or east of Imnesvale instead of west. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strrefs #17169, #19723)</span></li>
  <li>The description for Carrion Summons indicated that it would summon &quot;1d2&quot; carrion crawlers, but it's not a 50-50 chance. The spell has a 65% chance to summon two, and as such the language has been generalized. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strref #29212)</span></li>
  <li>Paralytic Bolts +1 were not listed their enchantment in their name <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strref #57918)</span></li>
  <li>The Sun Soulbeam ability does not roll for an attack, it just hits, contrary to its description.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (strrefs #74310, #100352)</span></li>
  <li>The ranger Charm Animal ability does not mention its duration. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strref #100356)</span></li>
  <li>Several of the  shapeshifting abilities and spells did not list all of their abilities; generally it was the weapon enchantment of their natural weapons. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strrefs #103011, #103237, #100374, #100375, #100390, #100391, #100392, #100393, #100394, #100395)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Mechanics Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The non-proficiency penalty for Shadowdancers and Mage-Thieves were incorrect. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(clswpbon.2da)</span></li>

  <li>Items with poison effects would block their own effects on a poison-immune target. However, in some cases, they were also blocking other, non-poison-related effects which should still apply.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (potn48.itm)</span></li>
  <li>Similar to the above, sleep and charms could also block unrelated effects when stopped by (half-)elven immunity.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (gorwom1.itm)</span></li>
  <li>The slow caused by an otyugh hit was a disease effect, but was not being cured by various disease cures. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(iotyugh.itm, ohrslng1.itm, otyugh.itm)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Area Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>There should be additional reinforcements at the Siege Camp, but a bad variable check prevented them. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(ar5203.bcs)</span></li>
  <li>The area script in one of Hexxat's quest areas can loop. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(oh7200.bcs)</span></li>
  <li>Several creatures were placed on impassable terrain, making them unable to move, or outside the bounds of the area. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(ar0305.are, ar0800.are, ar1000.are, ar2000.are, ar5202.are, ar6005.are, oh5500.are)</span></li>

  <li>In certain branches, Rasaad can duplicate items when he leaves the party due to how his actions are ordered. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(rasaadj.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>If you spare Solaufein, depending on the PC's replies Solaufein can hand over his cloak even though you never asked for it. He also misses setting some journal entries. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(udsola01.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>When Aerie leaves the party and returns to the circus, she could move to impassable ground <span class="bg2fp_modder">(aeriej.dlg, baerie.dlg)</span></li>

  <li>There are two versions of Full Plate Mail +2, one of which is a special version available via Wish that doesn't require any lore to identify. Several creatures were using the special version, which has been swapped for the other Full Plate +2. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(ohbgit01.cre, ohbthr01.cre, ohdcru04.cre, ohdlufpl.cre, ohnvgc.cre, ohrjassa.cre)</span></li>

  <li>The knockback effect of the Staff of the Ram +6 should not work on large creatures <span class="bg2fp_modder">(staf22.itm)</span></li>
  <li>Ilbratha's Mirror Image could be blocked by the wielder's magic resistance <span class="bg2fp_modder">(sw1h26.itm)</span></li>
  <li>The Longtooth dagger is described as exceptionally long and uses a short sword animation, but the range was still that of a dagger. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(dagg04.itm)</span></li>
  <li>The Paralytic Bolt +1 used the wrong dispellability, and magic resistance check.  <span class="bg2fp_modder">(sahbolt.itm)</span></li>
  <li>On 10% of hits Neera's Staff was supposed to inflict a point of fire damage on its wielder <strong>or</strong> its target, but was instead inflicting a point of fire damage on both. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(stafn1.itm)</span></li>

<h3> Animation Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>For larger creatures such as dragons, creature animations were typically split into four quadrants and stitched together on the game screen. Unfortunately, this could sometimes result in <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/image/823-issues-with-large-creature-animations-ii/">visible seams</a> between the four disparate animations or, if a spell was in effect, animations <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/image/822-issues-with-large-creature-animations-i/">cycling out of sync</a> with one another.

<h3>Polymorph Overhaul</h3>
<p>There were several ways that polymorphing--whether via a spell like Shapechange, a druid's natural abilities, or from an item like Cloak of the Wolf--could introduce numerous issues, especially when shifting directly between forms. A creature could retain stats or abilities from a previous form, or forced/voluntary/timed shapheshifts could overrun one another. As such, these abilities went through a complete overhaul designed to streamline the process, cover edge cases, and minimize issues. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bolt05.itm, brblp.itm, brbrp.itm, cdbrbrp.itm, cdbrbrp2.itm, cdgoliro.itm, cdmindfl.itm, cdwolfm.itm, clck04.itm, clck04.spl, clck27.itm, clck27a.spl, clck27b.spl, clck27c.spl, druear.itm, drufir.itm, earthrn.itm, figure01.itm, firern.itm, ohbpr608.spl, plybass.itm, plybear1.itm, plybear2.itm, plyflind.itm, plyjelly.itm, plymstar.itm, plysala.itm, plyspid.itm, plyspid2.itm, plytroll.itm, plywolf1.itm, plywyvrn.itm, polyjell.itm, polyrat.itm, slayerw1.itm, slayerw2.itm, slayerw3.itm, slayerw4.itm, spcl611.spl, spcl612.spl, spcl613.spl, spcl632.spl, spcl633.spl, spcl634.spl, spcl643.spl, spcl644.spl, spcl731.spl, spdm103.spl, spin107.spl, spin110.spl, spin111.spl, spin113.spl, spin122.spl, spin123.spl, spin124.spl, spin125.spl, spin126.spl, spin127.spl, spin150.spl, spin150r.eff, spin151.spl, spin152.spl, spin153.spl, spin154.spl, spin155.spl, spin156.spl, spin157.spl, spin160.spl, spin202.spl, spin663.spl, spin717.spl, spin717a.spl, spin783.spl, spin783a.spl, spin822.spl, spin823.spl, spin823a.spl, spin852.spl, spin852a.spl, spin868.spl, spin869.spl, spin974.spl, spinhum.spl, spinhume.eff, spinhume.spl, spinhumr.spl, spinhums.eff, spinhums.spl, spinhumw.eff, spinhumw.spl, splprot.2da, splstate.ids, sppr110.spl, sppr206.spl, sppr213.spl, sppr414.spl, sppr510.spl, sppr511.spl, sppr608.spl, sppr614.spl, sppr721.spl, sppr731.spl, sppr731a.spl, sppr732.spl, sppr732a.spl, spwi115.spl, spwi117.spl, spwi218.spl, spwi325.spl, spwi415.spl, spwi416.spl, spwi489.spl, spwi489r.eff, spwi490.spl, spwi491.spl, spwi493.spl, spwi494.spl, spwi495.spl, spwi496.spl, spwi497.spl, spwi498.spl, spwi499.spl, spwi518.spl, spwi711.spl, spwi711a.spl, spwi915.spl, spwi916.spl, spwi920.spl, spwi952.spl, spwm113.spl, spwm113a.spl, spwm183.spl, squirp.itm, trollall.itm, uddoor2.bcs, uddoor3.bcs, wand09.itm, wolfchar.cre, wolfgr.itm, wolfm.itm, wswolf.itm)</span></p>

<h3>Revamp of Hold, Paralysis, and Web</h3>
<p>In the original Baldur's Gate, there were four internal methods to make an NPC freeze: paralysis (used in undead melee attacks), web (used by the spell of the same name and spiders), and two forms of hold (one for Hold spells and a second, special one reserved for special cases like cutscenes). As the series progressed through the BG expansion, into BG2, and concluding with Throne of Bhaal, these were used more and more freely, and muddled--you had web spells using paralysis, abilities that blocked the special hold (which nothing should) to the point where there was little distinction, if any, between these effects from a player's point of view. EEFP is re-establishing the scheme, going all the way back to the original Baldur's Gate, of trying to use these effects in a way that 
  differentiates them and fixes a number of bugs along the way. Paralysis is, once again, the domain of undead attacks, and from which elves have some protection. Web is no longer paired by default with paralysis, meaning items which protect you from web no longer provide paralysis protection by accident, and the special hold will now always take effect. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(amul17.itm, antiweb.itm, ax1h10.itm, bhaalhp1.itm, bhaalimm.itm, blun12.itm, blun25.itm, chalcy3.itm, deva.itm, dragring.itm, dwfpdeva.spl, dwfpdgcn.spl, dwfpdgfb.spl, dwfpohdv.spl, dwfpsmsl.spl, dwfpsmst.spl, dwfpwwfs.spl, dwfpwwhs.spl, enginest.2da, ghoul1.itm, ghoult.itm, gorfirg.itm, gorjelgr.itm, gormisti.itm, hamm10.itm, hamm11.itm, immchs.itm, imoenhp1.itm, insanity.spl, ipsion.itm, jwsuper.itm, kuobolt3.itm, mage05.itm, magiweb.itm, mel01.itm, minhp1.itm, objring.itm, ohbbanno.spl, ohbdeva.itm, ohdmhp1.itm, ohhexam4.itm, ohnwand1.spl, ohrrage.spl, ohsmode1.spl, ohsmode4.spl, ring94.itm, ring95.itm, ring97.itm, ring98.itm, ring99.itm, ringkora.itm, rossring.itm, sengua04.itm, spcl152.spl, spcl233b.spl, spcl242.spl, spcl321.spl, spcl742.spl, spdr201.spl, spermel.itm, spin117.spl, spin566.spl, spin648.spl, spin683.spl, spin872.spl, spin906.spl, spin988.spl, sppr208.spl, sppr305.spl, sppr508.spl, sppr728.spl, sppr989.spl, spwi215.spl, spwi306.spl, spwi324.spl, spwi507.spl, spwi818.spl, spwi818a.spl, spwi918.spl, spwi918a.spl, spwm122.spl, stalker.itm, trollimm.itm, vampreg.itm, vampreg1.itm, vampreg2.itm, wand12.itm, wand14.itm)</span></p>
<h3>Immunity and Cure Fixes</h3>
<p>In the original Baldur's Gate II engine, something that made you 'immune to X' was actually fairly limited: you could make the character directly immune to the effect and (typically) the normal portrait icon, but many of the ancillary effects (sound effects, visuals, etc.) were hit or miss. A party member under free action would resist being paralyzed by a ghast, but the sound effect that plays when the paralysis was supposed to expire would still play. Similarly, creatures immune to confusion would resist the confusion itself but still play a spinning animation over their head for the spell's intended duration. Thankfully, the EEs provide more tools for dealing with immunities, and we can  block all of these subsidiary effects. A parallel issue occurred when removing or curing effects. If you used Remove Fear on a panicking creature, the spinning animation over their head didn't always go away or the expiration sound would still play. Using a new EE feature, these subsidiary effects can be removed when the main effect is removed. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(#cureber.spl, #curebld.spl, #curecon.spl, #curedef.spl, #curedis.spl,

  <h3>Internal Fixes</h3>
  <p>This is a roundup of fixes that primarily impact modders and are not visible to players. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Neothelid lacked an ini file and correct animate/anisnd.ids entries. (3001.ini, animate.ids, anisnd.ids)</li>
    <li>Several of the splprot.2da entries (specifically, alignment checks) were mislabeled. (splprot.2da)</li>
    <li>Kit ability tables for the archer, dark moon monk, and sun soul monk had missing entries for some columns. (clabmo02.2da, clabmo03.2da, clabrn02.2da)</li>
    <li>Various spells use feedback (op139) with non-permanent timing or non-zero durations. (helm32.itm, spin595.spl, spin878.spl, spin893.spl, spin929.spl, spin931.spl, spwi714.spl, spwi815.spl, spwi958.spl)</li>
    <li>Misindexed items and spells were fixed. (hamm06.itm, ohbwi302.spl, ohbwi304.spl, staf01.itm)</li>
    <li>Detect Evil no longer gets routed through a subspell. On the originals, only evil creatures got checked for magic resistance, which let you know that any 'magic resistance' creature was evil. On the EEs, everyone gets checked which means this is no longer a free check. (spcl212.spl, spin120.spl, sppr101.spl, spwi202.spl)</li>
    <li>Sleep icons are folded into op 39 directly on various sleep effects (spin940.spl, spwi004.spl, spwi213.spl, spwi411.spl, spwm187.spl) </li>
    <li>'Bypass mirror image' flags were set on a number of opcodes that don't support it (spin940.spl, spwi004.spl, spwi213.spl, spwm187.spl) </li>
    <li>Spells which use improved invisibility will no longer set normal invisibility as it's redundant (ohbwi405.spl, spdr401.spl, spin544.spl, spin698.spl, spwi405.spl, spwi505.spl) </li>
    <li>Removed duplicate and/or redundant effects from many items and spells (amul17.itm, bdddoorx.spl, bdsha01c.spl, bdsha06b.spl, bdspirim.itm, bdspnaim.itm, bhaalhp1.itm, bhaalimm.itm, blun30.itm, chalcy3.itm, clck04.itm, clck27.itm, dgarchon.spl, dragring.itm, gorchr.itm, gorfirg.itm, gorjelfu.itm, gorjelgr.itm, gormisti.itm, imoenhp1.itm, ipsion.itm, jwsuper.itm, lichtel.spl, mel01.itm, minhp1.itm, misc9y.itm, ohbbanno.spl, ohbdrkrg.itm, ohbjoke2.spl, ohdmhp1.itm, ohrboot1.itm, ohrfear.spl, ohtmps2d.spl, ohtmps2e.spl, potn23.itm, potn25.itm, potn32.itm, potn40.itm, potn45.itm, potn46.itm, ring09.itm, ring95.itm, rodsword.itm, rossring.itm, scrl10.itm, scrl11.itm, scrl12.itm, scrl13.itm, scrl18.itm, scrlpet.itm, sengua04.itm, shld24.itm, shld24a.itm, spcl152.spl, spcl321.spl, spcl611.spl, spcl612.spl, spcl613.spl, spcl632.spl, spcl633.spl, spcl634.spl, spcl643.spl, spcl644.spl, spcl722.spl, spcl900.spl, spcl901.spl, spdr301.spl, sper12.itm, spin107.spl, spin110.spl, spin111.spl, spin117.spl, spin121.spl, spin122.spl, spin123.spl, spin124.spl, spin125.spl, spin126.spl, spin127.spl, spin150.spl, spin151.spl, spin152.spl, spin153.spl, spin154.spl, spin155.spl, spin156.spl, spin157.spl, spin529.spl, spin632.spl, spin667.spl, spin710.spl, spin714.spl, spin717.spl, spin718.spl, spin718a.spl, spin783.spl, spin823.spl, spin852.spl, spin920.spl, spin952.spl, spinhum.spl, sppr111.spl, sppr319.spl, sppr508.spl, sppr517.spl, sppr613.spl, sppr701.spl, sppr704.spl, sppr717.spl, sppr717a.spl, sppr731.spl, sppr732.spl, spra302.spl, spra303.spl, sprngb03.itm, sprngb04.itm, sprngl03.itm, sprngl04.itm, sprngs01.itm, sprngs02.itm, sprngs03.itm, sprngs04.itm, sprngz05.itm, spwi002.spl, spwi222.spl, spwi308.spl, spwi311.spl, spwi318.spl, spwi415.spl, spwi489.spl, spwi490.spl, spwi491.spl, spwi493.spl, spwi494.spl, spwi495.spl, spwi496.spl, spwi497.spl, spwi498.spl, spwi499.spl, spwi511.spl, spwi522.spl, spwi618.spl, spwi701.spl, spwi705.spl, spwi711.spl, spwi723.spl, spwi902.spl, spwi997.spl, surehp1.itm, sw1h27.itm, sw2h21.itm, trollimm.itm, tstatue.itm, wand09.itm, wand19.itm)</li>
    <li>Effects with permanent timing shouldn't have durations (sppr202.spl)</li>
    <li>Various spells and items had to have effects reorganized to facilitate other fixes (ax1h10.itm, blun12.itm, blun25.itm, deva.itm, dwfpdeva.spl, dwfpdgcn.spl, dwfpdgfb.spl, dwfpohdv.spl, dwfpsmsl.spl, dwfpsmst.spl, dwfpwwfs.spl, dwfpwwhs.spl, hamm10.itm, hamm11.itm, insanity.spl, ohbdeva.itm, spermel.itm, wand12.itm)</li>
    <li>Several spells that used swarms of EFFs have been recoded with cleaner  implementations  (sppr313.spl, sppr314.spl, sppr707.spl, sppr707a.spl, sppr707b.spl, sppr707c.spl, sppr710.spl, sppr715.spl) </li>
